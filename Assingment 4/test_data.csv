Lyrics,Song Title,Genre
i live in a little house on the side of the street where the grass is dead but they water the concrete in the summer i watch the people float by in the winter i watch them weep and cry i live in a little house on the side of the street i live in a little house on the side of the road where the people starve just to feed their cars and boats in the fall the men they stomp and shout in the spring the women frolic about i live in a little house on the side of the road yeah oh try to believe that work will set you free only wise men see that we were always free i live in a place where the people wonder why why the grass is always greener on the other side in the day they go to work and wait in the night they drink their fears away i live in a place where the people wonder why oh try to believe that work will set you free only wise men see that we were always were always free yeah yeah oh try to believe that work will set you free oh try to believe that work will set you free only wise men see that we were always always free yeah we were always free what the hell nice but ill drink another drink and then well do it again,Always Free,Blues
