"Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you
I know sometimes you may wonder
From little things I say and do
But there's no need for you to wonder
If I need you, 'cause I'll need you
Too many times I don't tell you
Too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you
Still you show me, in every way",'Till the Rivers All Run Dry,Country
"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot, now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot, Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

"Riding in the sunset
Both hands on the wheel
Lost in a memory
Of the way that you feel, oh am I crazy?

Pulled in the parking lot
Her car's parked on the street
I forget about those bitter tears
When I hear her talking so sweet

Oh, isn't that my heart wondering?
Am I crazy for wondering?
Tell me why I keep running
Back to the heartbreak kid

Step through the doorway
A hush falls on the room
Everybody here wants to see

Who'll make the first move

Oh, isn't that my heart wondering?
Am I crazy for wondering?
Tell me why I keep running

I let the pleasure ease the pain
Across the room her eyes meet mine
I play the fool one more time

"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven
{Oh what a beautiful sight}

Spoken:
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven. And you know who greeted me at the gate? The ole 
cowboy-philosopher himself, Will Rogers. He said to me, he said ""Tex, the Big Boss of the riders 
up here has asked me to kinda show you around. Now, over yonder are a couple of your ole compadres."" 
My, was I glad to see them, Carson Robison and the Mississippi blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers.

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven
{Oh what a beautiful sight}

Spoken:
He introduced me to Wiley Post, and he showed me the Hall of Fame with all the gold guitars and fiddles 
hanging on the walls. Then he said, ""Tex, step over this way, there are two more of your friends I know 
you'll want to see, they're waitin' for you."" There they were standin' side by side and smilin' at me--
Hank Williams and Johnny Horton. 

I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven
{Oh what a star-studded night}

Spoken:
Then I asked him who else do you expect in the next, uh, say a hundred years? He handed me a large book 
covered with star dust. Will called it the Big Tally Book. In it were many names and each name was branded 
in pure gold. I began to read some of them as I turned the pages: Red Foley, Ernest Tubb, Gene Autry, 
Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Tennessee Ernie, Jimmy Dean, Andy Griffith, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter (Whaaaatttt???)

"I saw you through a cafe window down on second avenue
The passage of time sure has been good to you
I was tempted for just a moment to run out in the street
But what do you say when two old lovers meet

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn’t let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone

You’re the one who’s missing me

Woth the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

For whats dead now is safe
The exiled, a home where the soul kept safe
Take me back on the crest of a wave
No more tears for you paddy's lament
No more tears
No more paddy's
Lament

Rip the greet from his heart
Theres no sorrow tonight
For once banished dreams sleep divine
Where the silence you hear is the prosper we shared
The only blade is a razor sharp smile
Still the church bell rings the collective sings that still roam
But the only thing left is the pain of nothing once more

[Chorus]

Grab the leaf of the branch from the tree in the ground
Where the roots claimed the earth many tioled
To a land that now stands under no-ones command
And her beauty let no man destroy
So remember the gun and the damage it's done
The last drop as been spilled for you and I
Let there be no despair for the rule we once shared
Brush the tear from the eye that still shines

Where the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

"Foi sem mais nem menos
Que um dia selei a 125 azul

Foi sem graça nem pensando na desgraça
Que eu entrei pelo calor
Sem pendura que a vida já me foi dura

Nem o homem da portagem na entrada da auto-estrada
A ponte ficou deserta nem sei mesmo se Lisboa
Não partiu para parte incerta
Viva o espaço que me fica pela frente e não me deixa recuar
Sem paredes, sem ter portas nem janelas
Nem muros para derrubar

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Curiosamente dou por mim pensando onde isto me vai levar
De uma forma ou outra há-de haver uma hora para a vontade de parar
Só que à frente o bailado do calor vai-me arrastando para o vazio
E com o ar na cara, vou sentindo desafios que nunca ninguém sentiu

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Será que existe em mim um passaporte para sonhar

"A peine arrivée, avec tes idées, avec ta façon de dire non.
Tu débarques dans ma vie comme un boulet de canon.
Mais tu es tellement jolie, tu prends tellement de proportions.
Qu'c'est la révolution 1789.

Tu prends les habitudes, tu les flanques au panier.
Tu prends mon vieux fauteuil, mon portefeuille.
Tu les jettes par la fenêtre et tu ne veux rien reconnaître.
De tout ce qui était là bien avant toi:
Mon vieux pyjama, mon lit, ma pipe et mon tabac.
Tu ne veux plus voir tout ça.
Et tu décroches les rideaux, et tu les jettes à l'eau.
Avec du rideau vieux on fait du neuf.
C'est 1789.

Et tu me barricades, et j'en prends pour mon grade.
On s'croirait à l'époque des sans culottes.
Ils avaient pris la Bastille pour libérer leurs enfants.
Toi tu t'en prends à la vie.
Mais c'est pour m'enfermer dedans à perpétuité.
Oui, c'est pour m'enfermer dedans.
Mais la liberté, crois-moi, e n'était pas du bluff en 1789.",1789,Country
"Some will say it’s not even funny
And there you stand, not even trying
They say it is in line with the aging
Sometimes noise is just your mind
But the lesson is vague and the lightning
Shows a deer with her mind on the moor
And now something with the sun is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
As I lower down I hear it’s a message

And it’s 1902 telling people to get out
If there was a just a way I could tell them
It’s been long, but you are right
The singing is slow and so quiet
Like the sound when you sweep off the floor
And now something with the dirt is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
When the night is young
But the bridge is up

Something passing by our shore
The only one you can tell it to
Is the only one that will know
As one rock was made to go through my window
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
You’re living with no light or direction but damn precise
And now you know
That believing is hard but you go now
And you feel what you drag across the floor

And now something in these trails is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
Some will say it’s not even healthy
But body is young and mind is sure
That at least something is alright with your thinking
Because they shook the earth in 1904.",1904,Country
"Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through
And now its clear that she is what I should have held on to

[Chorus]
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty
But I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
Its that same ole lost love story
Its sad but its true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982

Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last

"My life was right in front of me but now she's gone
Now it's easy to see I was the one who was wrong
How could I be that close and yet so far of the track
Well I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
Yes it's clear to me now but I should've seen it all along
Why was I so blind to what I had at home

When a woman's not satisfied it don't take her long to pack
Well I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
Lord it hurts to see it all when there's nothing I can do
Loving her now that it's too late makes me just a fool

For my life has changed and I'm sure rearranged
You've made me everything I wanna be

I don't need Dr. Ruth to figure out the truth
This feeling just can't be denied

I'm gonna quit watching my TV
Gonna throw my golf clubs away
No more shooting pool, acting a fool
And party 'til the break of day

'Cause she's the only thing in the whole wide world
That ever made me feel this fine
Oh, and anything that takes me away from her
Is nothing but a waste of my time

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Every second each day til' I'm old a gray
This fascination will survive
I love her, 24-7-365

Ah, it's my life at stake
And it's time for me to make
A change is long overdue
I don't need no resume, I threw it all away
I'm gonna do what I was born to do

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Oh, I don't need no pay, I just wanna say
I bless the day she arrived

She sat alone on a bus out of Beaumont
The courage of just 18 years
A penny and quarter were taped to a letter
And momma's goodbye in her ears

She watched as her high school faded behind her
And the house with the white picket fence
Then she read the note that her momma had wrote
Wrapped up with 26 cents

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

A penny and a quarter buys a whole lot of nothing
Taped to an old wrinkled note
And when she didn't have much she had all momma's love
Inside that old envelope

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all

Don't want the devil to be taking my soul

I don't give a f*ck if they get into the chart, oh no 
Only way I can be, is to say what I see 
And have my shadow hanging over me

'Cause everybody always fucking changes their mind

"Mama locked the door last night
For the first time in all of her years
I said mama you gotta be kidding me
She said things ain't like they used to be round here
You just wouldn't believe it
Kids growing up without Jesus
Good thing your daddy ain't here to see this now
They stay higher than the water tower
In this thirty five mile an hour town

She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze
I've had a backroad buzz or two, myself
It seems like heaven is slipping further away
The devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell
We used to burn a hole through midnight
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and on a good night
Might kill a 5th of Crown but now
There's a lower higher power
In this thirty five mile an hour town

Oh we can't blame the babies for growing up lazy
And crazy it ain't them that let them down
If they ain't stealing, they're suing
Why work when we'll give it to 'em
It's right there in the bible that we don't put out
Spare the rod and you'll sour
A thirty five mile an hour town

The ""yes mam's gone and the ""please's too,
It's out the door with the ""thank you"" in the evening
You don't see a front yard football game
The neighbor kids have done away with the shirt and skins
No one hits the front porch lights
To get the kids to come inside
'Cause the streets ain't safe for a bike to ride down
Since they planted a prowler

How fast they drive this thirty five mile an hour

I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
Then said, ""What else you got left?""
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, ""Don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""

I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum
I asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, ""No, dear.""
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red,
Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then, you never wasted time.
And I, I never took much,
I never asked for your crutch
And I don't ask for mine.",4th Time Around,Country

I remember the night that you gave me this picture.  I ought to - I've relived it so many times.  I remember how I couldn't wait to get home and put in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.

(A souvenir of things that might have been)
Because you WERE mine, at least till someone else came along and took you off out of my sight.  It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture, though.  Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.

It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame but I'm jealous of anything that's close to you.  And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight.  That looks like more than I'll ever do.  I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame and be so close to the lips that I love.  I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold but sometimes it's just not enough.

"Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota
To fight for the red, white and blue
He was nineteen and green with a new M-16
Just doing what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the sergeant said look up ahead

Like a dark evil cloud
Twelve-hundred came down on him and twenty-nine more
They fought for their lives but most of them died 
In the one-seventythird Airborne

On the eighth of November the angels were crying
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the eighth of November

Now he's fifty-eight and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the Shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

And held you when you were alone
For you were the rock that was
Broken by love, forever the fragile stone

By His gentle and powerful hand
The mystery of mercy undid your denials
At last you could finally stand

The door that He closed was your fear
Simply to rest in the arms of His love
Made all your doubts disappear

And held you when you were alone

Broken by love, forever the fragile stone

In time they will reach everywhere

Além dela ser bonita é um poço de bondade
Vendo meu carro na chuva ofereceu sua garagem

Ela disse, ninguém usa desde que ele me deixou

Põe teu carro aqui dentro, se não vai enferrujar
A garagem é usada mas teu carro vai gostar

Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Que eu uso pra vender cocos e ganhar mais um trocado
A garagem é pequena, o que é que eu faço agora?
O meu carro fica dentro, os cocos ficam de fora
A minha vizinha é boa, da garagem vou cuidar
Na porta mato cresceu, dei um jeito de cortar

I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world

Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden

Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number

And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it

"Dear heart there is something I must tell you
Something sad and so hard for me to say
For I know how much you always loved her
And how you always hoped that she'd come back someday

But day after day my hopes grow dimmer as I watched life and love passing me by
And the life I live is empty and so lonely
But you just lived for her and slowly let me die
You know she left me for another so give her up let her go let it be

"Dear Santa Claus, It's been so long
So long since I have written
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled
I've moved from there and now I live 
On disillusion avenue
And I've been here longer than I care to tell

The twinkling bells of hope and joy
The laughter that rang in my voice
Have silenced more and more as time goes by
Those treasured gifts from other years
Are tarnished, lost or stained with tears
So Santa would you bring a new supply

I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
My faith is gone, my courage low, my patience ran out long ago
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year

Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness
And the grudges that I've gathered through the years
And leave a large bag of forgiveness
To give out to those who robbed me 
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine
Lost it one too many times
And make the new one longer if you can

I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day

"He was a long, tall stranger from way down south 
Where he'd left his life behind 
He had a big, old Gibson and a pickup truck 
And Shenandoah eyes 
And I remember him sitting in that local bar 
Where I earned my pay each night 
Singing my songs to empty chairs and going home half tight

So the nights rolled by like headlights shining on a lonesome strip of tar 
I kept his word of kindness close to me like a pick on my guitar 
And we talked about the singers and the songs we loved 
And the songs we'd most forgot 
In that run-down bar they'd make last call 
And I'd never want to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I was living on nothing but a young girl's dreams 
With my cowboy boots and my old six-string 
Hitching my wagon to a star
Dreaming of leaving those local bars 
When I'd get him up at closing time 
For a couple of songs and a chance to shine 
Like the star that he longed to be 
He looked a hell of a lot like me

Well, he'd played a lot of places where the only wages were food and beer for free 
No fancy licks, but he had him a gift for the kinds of songs he'd sing 
But you do what you can to be a satisfied man 
Just to have your peace of mind 
So he gave it all up for a government job where the paychecks come on time

So now he comes to the bar to hear me play guitar 
And to share a drink or two 
And we sit swapping tales of where we've been and what we'd rather do 
There's a wealth of dangers when you're talking to strangers 
And I meet them all the time 
But my heart knew better than my head when I looked into those eyes

[Chorus]

Well, maybe I'll quit when I've got me a kid and a place to call my own 
But tonight there ain't nobody there waiting up for me at home 
It's a helluva way to live from day to day 
Not knowing where you're bound 
But the look in his eyes made me realize 
I was glad for the life I'd found

But hangs you to dry,
The shameful dream, the shameful face

Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,

BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""

Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make
Things disappear. But the father played too
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass
Disappears, He'd come to someone about
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son!"" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat, people, up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:

Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question and I replied

"A little maiden climbed an old man's knees—
Begged for a story: ""Do uncle, please! 
Why are you single, why live alone?
Have you no babies, have you no home?"" 
""I had a sweetheart, years, years ago, 
Where she is now, pet, you will soon know; 
List to the story, I'll tell it all: 
I believed her faithless after the ball.“
”Bright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom,
Softly the music playing sweet tunes. 
There came my sweetheart, my love, my own,
‘I wish some water; leave me alone.'
When I returned, dear, there stood a man 
Kissing my sweetheart as lovers can. 
Down fell the glass, pet, broken, that's all—
Just as my heart was after the ball.“
”Long years have passed, child, I have never wed, 
True to my lost love though she is dead. 
She tried to tell me, tried to explain—
I would not listen, pleadings were vain. 
One day a letter came from that man; 
He was her brother, the letter ran. 
That's why I'm lonely, no home at all—
I broke her heart, pet, after the ball.""
Chorus: 
After the ball is over, after the break of morn, 
After the dancers' leaving, after the stars are gone, 
Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all—
Source: Many the hopes that have vanished after the ball.",After the Ball,Country

She flew off in a rage
Third time this week

Let me know there's someplace left for me
Waiting there for me

Ah, who am I kiddin'
I should have known he'd never leave
The time we spend together
Is harder than the time between

You wouldn't think it could hurt so
To see 'em out the other day
If that's what he calls leavin'
I guess I threw it all away

And time just slips away

Somehow we always make it through

Why the angels turn their backs on some

Upon the little town of Bethlehem 
The shepherds in their fields
Were amazed at the sound
Of angels singing in Jerusalem 

The wise men made their way 
Every traveling night and day 
With myrrh and frankincense and gifts of gold 
While Mary, meek and mild 
Labored with her first born child 
And Joseph sheltered with her from the cold 

The angels and the animals 
Were kneeling to His glory 
To praise the Son of God 
Come once upon a time 
The promised Prince of Peace 
The babe in swaddling clothes 
In his mothers arms did sleep 
Embraced within a lullaby of light 
The angels sang on high 
The song of heaven bright 
Redemption came upon that blessed night 

The trembling voice of shepherd 
The harp that played a melody 
And Joseph knew among the straw 
The glory of divinity 
The promised prince of peace 
So let us sing his praise 
The baby King of light 
And make a place within our manger stall 
His promise is renewed 
Upon this Christmas night For you, for me, for shepherd King and all

Relieves us of our poverty 
And we are rich in blessing

"One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English park
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart

One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me
Now I smoke like a chimney
It's getting dark in this heart of mine
It's getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away

One went out in the back streets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, have no doubt
When I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though we will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore

One lights up every time we feel love in our hearts
One dies when it moves away

I was hanging around in my house
I had that old book with picutres of Madonna naked
And I was checkin' it out
Just then a friend of mine came to the door
She said she never pegged me for a scumbag before
Said she didn't ever want to see me no more
And I still don't why/

I'm pretty sure I can still be the President
But I don't think I'll ever get to be the Pope

I think I'm an alright guy

You know just the other night
The cops pulled me over outside the bar
When they turned on their lights
And they ordered me out my car
Man I was only kiddin' when I called 'em a couple of dicks
But still they made me do the stupid human tricks
Now I'm stuck in this jail with a bunch of dumb hicks
And I still don't know why

With a second hand glove and dirt on my face

Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings I thank god I was

Born inside an American child

"Worked all his life in the rail yards
Summer heat, winter cold
He sits by the fire, now he’s retired
But he don’t really feel all that old

She comes in from the kitchen
And sits on the arm of his chair
He looks up and says, “Hey, lady, I love you”
Runs his fingers through her hair

And there’s a picture on the wall of Jesus in the garden
It’s been there since they got the house in ’53
Hey, they ain’t no big deal whatever go down in history
It’s just a little story of an American family

She waited for him in World War two
He fought the European campaign
Their son John spent two years in Nam
That war it wasn’t the same

Billy’s out in L.A., he’s a lawyer now
They worry he's so far away
Jeannie got married and lives here in town
She's comin’ over with the kids today

And there’s a picture on the wall of Jesus in the garden
It’s been there since they got the house in ’53
Hey, there ain’t no big deal, whatever go down in history
It’s just a little story of an American family

But the whole world is different now
Blood's been spilled on our shores
In hard times we pull together

With dirt on his hands and a loan on his back
He's the man that puts the food on your table
He's the man that grows the clothes on your back

Tending on the sidelines and watching him fall
Selling his land to the big corporations
What you gonna do when they get it all

He's been rolled for sure treated like a outlaw
Turned down sold out, put out to graze
He's been pushed you know when he can push no more
It gets a little harder everyday

He's the American farmer
And he damn hard to beat
Better wake up America, wake up America
'Cause if the man don't work then the people don't eat

I can't figure what where doing it for
We should be sending the wheat and meat and cotton

Eatin' outta garbage cans, sleepin' in the street
See that baby, moping in the kitty
To make ends meet

Hungry people everywhere you go
Children in Africa starving by the fields
While the land lays fallow and the banks foreclose

She had my head spinning faster than them four bald eagle tires

I was all caught up in that American love
Two young hearts, one cool car
And all we wanted to do was park, kiss, smoke, drink

We were living it up, up, up in that American love

We were naming all the stars up in that sky
And I named the brightest one right after her
And the summer sunset was something to see
With her leaning all up real close to me
And with a six pack, the next thing I knew, we were in the backseat, you know

For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind

I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,

Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win

Out here the cold wind blows

I wondered if she knows
The first word she said to me was goodbye

Back home my wife and daughter
Don't know where I am tonight
But soon I will find a road that leads home

All that she knows right now
Is that her father is still gone

"Well, the Amtrak Crescent is a north bound train
When you can't afford to stay no more in New Orleans
So I bought the cheapest ticket, and I carried my clothes
And the blood beneath my eyes from a broken nose
When life goes wrong, this train goes on and on
When life goes wrong, this train goes on

Well, there ain't no ham like the Birmingham
To make a fella want to stay in Alabam
But I crossed into Georgia into Eastern Time
And dared to eat a peach to take it off my mind
When life goes wrong, this train goes on

Somewhere between right and wrong
Somehow I manage to keep moving on
Searching for any place but where I am
And a first and second chance

At stop in Charlotte found a hog's leg joint
Seemed like forever till we reached High Point
Now, Lynchburg to Danville - that's a ghost filled rail
If you listen, you can hear the engineer's wife wail
When life goes wrong, this train goes on

Better say Manassas if you say Bull Run
Or in Virginia you won't get along with anyone
But just across the river you can change your tune
Like all the politicians there in DC do
When life goes wrong, they just go on

Somewhere between right and wrong
Somehow I manage to keep moving on
Searching for any place but where I am
And a first and second chance

Now it's more New York down to Baltimore
It took so much effort just to move this train
Why does everything around me have to look the same?

Half to fall

Why not just free them
And stop the pain?

If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

"I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's, where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes, I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ah, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left

With whiskey on my breath
I know I should be ashamed

Tryin' to make her disappear

If she knew the truth
See, I told her when she left
This was the last thing I would do
Tomorrow I swear I'm startin' over again
I've made it this far and I know how it ends
But she doesn't have to find out where I am
So if you see or hear from here again

Tell her I'm in Mobile, Alabama

They say about you as far as I'm concerned
I think it's time they learn that nothing I have heard
Could make me doubt you as far as I'm concerned.

Than to look for happiness with someone new
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned.

"Gonna stay in bed today
'cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down

I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me

It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you it's alright

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself and I

Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got
It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
'cause it all falls into place

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him

Face to face, eye to eye
You're standing there
Feels good on the inside

I don't mind, I don't care
You're standing there
Seein' me for the first time

Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me

As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing

"She left without leavin' a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got

If your callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowlin'
If you've got somethin' to sell your wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake and I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home on Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you

Well this time she left her number
But not another word
When she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If your callin' 'bout my heart it's still yours
I should have listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy this is no machine your talkin' to
Can't you tell this is Austin and I still love you

I still love you",Austin,Country

Tryin' so hard not to see all the things that I see
Almost willing to lie again
I swear that it just isn't so, it just isn't me

Then I go and open my eyes again
Love in your eyes is the thing that I'd most like to see
I'd be willing to die again
to know of a place and a time that it always will be

Chorus: This is my autograph
Here in the songs that I sing
Here in My cry and my laugh
Here in the love that I bring
To be always with you
And you always with me

you are the ove and the light that we all need to see
always willin' to shine and then
Peace on this Earth is the way that it always can be

"Well I stepped into an avalanche,
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

Do not dress in those rags for me,
I know you are not poor
You don't love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure,
It is your turn, beloved,
It is your flesh that I wear.",Avalanche,Country

Storie fotografate dentro un album rilegato in pelle
Tuoni di aerei supersonici che fanno alzar la testa
E il buio all'alba che si fa d'argento alla finestra
Avrai un telefono vicino che vuol dire già aspettare
Schiuma di cavalloni pazzi che s'inseguono nel mare
E pantaloni bianchi da tirare fuori che già estate
Un treno per l'America senza fermate
Avrai due lacrime più dolci da seccare
Un sole che si uccide e pescatori di telline
E neve di montagne e pioggia di colline
Avrai un legnetto di cremino da succhiare
Avrai una donna acerba e un giovane dolore
Viali di foglie in fiamme ad incendiarti il cuore
Avrai una sedia per posarti e ore
Vuote come uova di cioccolato
Ed un amico che ti avrà deluso tradito ingannato
Avrai avrai avrai
Il tuo tempo per andar lontano
Camminerai dimenticando
Ti fermerai sognando

Avrai parole nuove da cercare quando viene sera
E cento ponti da passare e far suonare la ringhiera

Natale di agrifoglio e candeline rosse
Avrai un lavoro da sudare
Mattini fradici di brividi e rugiada
Giochi elettronici e sassi per la strada
Avrai ricordi ombrelli e chiavi da scordare
Avrai carezze per parlare con I cani
E sarà sempre di domenica domani
E avrai discorsi chiusi dentro e mani
Che frugano le tasche della vita

"A story bout a pal of mine who worked down near the Georgia Line
A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the hits no more.",B.J. the D.J.,Country

"Little girl ( little girl ) baby girl
 She's my darling little precious baby girl
 Like an angel to me and I know that he
 Sent from Heaven my little baby girl
She's as sweet as the flowers of springtime
Her blue eyes they sparkle so bright
Just a touch of her little baby hand
Seems to guide my weary footsteps day and night
How those two little arms try to hold me
Her little heart's a blessing to our home
And at night when I'm far far away
As dream of her I'm never all alone",Baby Girl,Country

I got to have all your lovin'

For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep

Empty nights
Echo your name
Sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same 

Oh yeah, when you see me smile
You know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

This loneliness inside me darlin'

I'm gonna stay right here by your side do my best to keep you satisfied

There's time to make love
 
I came, I saw, I conquered

Keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering those words of prophesy
 
I may come easy, but I don't come free
You're never gonna see the last of me
Baby, you look good to me tonight

"Yeah back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

When I think about how it used to be, Lord it was so simple then
Dirt-bike and a fishin' pole at a fishin' hole with all my friends
Nothin' better than a BB gun in my backyard just huntin' squirrels
Took a ring from my mama's drawer and gave it to this little girl
Her mama called mine and then my daddy had to have a talk
I remember like yesterday what he said when we took that walk
""Son don't you ever tell no lie, even if the truth burns""
Everyday my mind goes back to all those lessons learned
And I wanna go

I remember that Texaco that Mr. Logan used to own
They turned it into something else and Mr. Logan's long gone
My best friend David, he grew up ridin' in that wheelchair
Thought I'd give a million bucks if that old boy was still here
Ain't it funny how time goes by and memories seem to fade away
They built a parking lot on the baseball field we used to play
That skating rink is closed down, but now I see us back again
I remember those all night skates, very first dates and my old friend

When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back

Wish I was

My dad's gettin' older now but son he's still as tough as ever
Him and my little boy are best friends now, wish it could last forever
My mama is still the one I talk to when I need advice
She never ever let me down
God what will I do when she's not around

Some day it will just fill you

And you mail yourself right inside
And there's nowhere to go
Except out real slow

Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you

[Chorus]

Oh buddy I've seen you making your play for the baby doll on my arm
You'd better back up and get out of my way, I'd hate to do you harm
I'll give you a hint that'll help you a lot, get a doll that's all your own
I'll give you most any thing I got but leave my baby alone

[Chorus]

I'm crazy in love and maybe that's why I'm a little bit jealous too
So back away boy, don't give her the eye, don't make me mad at you
I never have been the troublesome kind but it never too late to start
And trouble is what the joker will find that flirts with my sweetheart

"Back when we were young everybody came to see us
Everybody wanted to be us back when we were young
We loved each other so all our friends told one another
And we even told each other back when we were young

It was laughin' it was dancin' 
I was cigarettes and bourbon flavored kisses
It was alligator shoes and new blue suits
And anything that money wishes
It was sittin' up all night and waitin' 
For the dawn to bring another wondrous day
It was holding hands and thinking 
That tomorrow is a million years away

Back when we were young everybody came to see us
Everybody wanted to be us back when we were young
We loved each other so all our friends told one another
And we even told each other back when we were young

It was rolling seventh of a time 
And thinking it was never ever gonna end
Back then we even thought of time itself 
As being something as a passing friend
It was buyin' one another things we didn't need
And birthdays were so corny
Back then we even had some friends

At fourty a month a plum good buckaroo
Well, the boss comes around and he says,
""Hey, my lad, well you look pretty good ridin' horses that's bad.""
You see, I ain't got no more outlaws to break
But I'll buy you a ticket and I'll give you a stake.
At ridin' them bad ones, well, you ain't slow
And you might do some good at the big rodeo.

While they're puttin' the bull in the chute
I'm a strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
I looks that bull over and to my suprise
Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes
On top of his shoulders he's got a big hump
I cinch's my riggin' just back of that lump
I latch in his middle and I lets out a scream
He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream.

Well he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
But I ain't no green horn - I'm still sittin' tight
The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin
He's a wavin' them horns right under my chin
At sunnin' his belly he couldn't be beat
He's showin' the buzzards the soles of his feet
He's a dippin' so low that my boots filled with dirt
He's a makin' a whip of the tail of my shirt.

He's snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes
He's a buckin' and a bawlin' and a blowin' his nose
The crowd starts to cheerin' both me and that bull
Well, he needed no help, but I had my hands full
Then he went to fence rowin' and a weavin behind
My head went poppin' - I sorta went blind
He starts in high divin' - I lets out a groan
We went up together, but he come back alone.

Up high I turns over and below I can see
He's a pawin' up dirt just a waitin' for me
I can picture a grave and a big slab of wood
Sayin', ""Here lies a twister who thought he was good.""
I notice this somethin' don't seem can be true
But the brand on his hip was a big Flyin' U
When I landed he charged, but I got enough sense
So I ran that old bull to the hole in the fence.

I dives through that hole and I want you to know

When I was lost with nothing to count on
Now I lie here smiling all night long
And I wonder where my bad old days have gone

The danger's in the telling I'm tempted to be bright
When the truth is they were bad old days and didn't have to turn out right
I love you more than morning and part of the reason why
Is you helped me kiss those bad old days goodbye

Oh, I wonder where my bad old days have gone
When I was lost with nothing to count on
Now I lie here smiling all night long
And I wonder where my bad old days have gone

You're quiet in the morning, you like to wake up slow
You need your coffee before you talk, I remember you tellin' me so
Was it sixteen years ago or was it yesterday
That you came and chased my bad old days away?

"In seventy-six the sky was red
thunder rumbling overhead
Bad King George couldn't sleep in his bed
And on that stormy morn, Ol' Uncle Sam was born.
Some birthday! 

Ol' Sam put on a three cornered hat
And in a Richmond church he sat
And Patrick Henry told him that while America drew breath
It was ""Liberty or death."" 

What kind of hat is a three-cornered hat?
Did they all believe in liberty in those days? 

Nobody who was anybody believed it.
Ev'rybody who was anybody they doubted it.
Nobody had faith.
Nobody but Washington, Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin,
Chaim Solomon, Crispus Attucks, Lafayette. Nobodies.
The nobodies ran a trea party at Boston. Betsy Ross
organized a sewing circle. Paul Revere had a horse race. 

And a little ragged group believed it.
And some gentlemen and ladies believed it.
And some wise men and some fools, and I believed it too.
And you know who I am.
No. Who are you mister? Yeah, how come all this?
Well, I'll tell you. It's like this... No let us tell you.
Mister Tom Jefferson, a mighty fine man. 
He wrote it down in a mighty fine plan.
And the rest all signed it with a mighty fine hand
As they crossed thier T's and dotted their I's
A bran' new country did arise. 

And a mighty fine idea. ""Adopted unanimously in Congress July 4, 1776,
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable 
rights.
That among these rights are Life, Yes sir!, Liberty, That's right!
And the pursuit of happiness."" 
Is that what they said? The very words.
That does sound mighty fine. 

Buildiing a nation is awful tough.
The people found the going rough.
Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who anybody they stayed at home.
But Lewis and Clarke and the pioneers,
Driven by hunger, haunted by fears,
The Klondike miners and the forty niners,
Some wanted freedom and some wanted riches,
Some liked to loaf while others dug ditches.
But they believed it. And I believed it too,
And you know who I am.
No, who are you anyway, Mister? 

Well, you see it's like this. I started to tell you.
I represent the whole... Why that's it!
Let my people go. That's the idea!
Old Abe Lincoln was thin and long,
His heart was high and his faith was strong.
But he hated oppression, he hated wrong,
And he went down to his grave to free the slave. 

A man in white skin can never be free while his black brother is in 
slavery,
""And we here highly resolve that these dead shall not haave died in 
vain.
And this government of the people, by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the Earth.""
Abraham Lincoln said that on November 19, 1863 at Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania.
And he was right. I believe that too. 

Say, we still don't know who you are, mister.
Well, I started to tell you...
The machine age came with a great big roar,
As America grew in peace and war.
And a million wheels went around and 'round.
The cities reached into the sky,
And dug down deep into the ground.
And some got rich and some got poor.
But the people carried through,
So our country grew.

Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who was anybody they doubted it.
And they are doubting still,
And I guess they always will,
But who cares what they say whem I am on my way 

Say, will you please tell us who you are?
What's your name, Buddy? Where you goin'? Who are you?
Well, I'm the everybody who's nobody, 
I'm the nobody who's everybody.
What's your racket? What do you do for a living? 

Well, I'm an
Engineer, musician, street cleaner, carpenter, teacher,
How about a farmer? Also. Office clerk? Yes sir!
That's right. Certainly!
Factory worker? You said it. Yes ma'am.
Absotively! Posolutely!
Truck driver? Definitely!
Miner, seamstress, ditchdigger, all of them.
I am the ""etceteras"" and the ""and so forths"" that do the work.
Now hold on here, what are you trying to give us?
Are you an American? 
Am I an American?
I'm just an Irish, Jewish, Italian, 
French and English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish, 
Scotch, Hungarian, Swedish, Finnish, Greek and Turk and Czech 

And that ain't all.
I was baptized Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Luthern, 
Atheist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Presbyterian, Seventh Day Adventist,
Mormon, Quaker, Christian Scientist and lots more.
You sure are something. 

Our country's strong, our country's young, 
And her greatest songs are still unsung.
From her plains and mountains we have sprung,
To keep the faith with those who went before. 

We nobodies who are anybody believe it.
We anybodies who are everybody have no doubts.
Out of the cheating, out of the shouting.

Deep as our valleys,
High as our mountains,
Strong as the people who made it.
For I have always believed it, and I believe it now,
And now you know who I am.
Who are you?

Oh, I was born with the name Geraldine
With hair coal black as a raven.
I travelled my life without a care,
Ah, but all my love I was savin'.
Oh, the winds blew high and the trees did sway,
Not much from life was I askin'.
Till I met someone to give all my love,
All my love, so long an' lasting.
Oh, good were the parts we played in our game
And a long ways off was tomorrow.
But my love was a rambler and restless as the sea,
And in the tide came sorrow.
Oh, a child of the night is goin' to be born,
I can't explain my confusion.
Is my love thinkin' to marry me at all
Or of the freedom he thinks he'll be losin'?
I sit with my friends in the gay crowded room,
My friends they're smokin' and a-talkin'.
But it all seems so empty, my love is not there,
So I'll go into the streets a-walkin'.
My baby is a-growin' as a-growin' it must,
If I were to lose it, it would grieve me.
My love is so helpless and I'm wonderin' what to do.
Oh, how I yearn to help him.
Oh, we could go to the land of your choice
Where the false shame won't come knockin' at our door.
I've a feeling in my heart and it's crushing all my hopes,

Down the ditches a thousand years
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Til the white man stole their water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now, Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Or the marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived
To walk back down again
And when the fight was over
And Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Or the marine that went to war

Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Or the marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Or the marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",Ballad of Ira Hayes,Country
"Here's to you Nicholas and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts

"Looking for a reason not to stay drunk
All the time
Fell my way through the creases 
Of those wrinkled linen sheets
Of time

You wondered off to Mexico
Leaving late no one know you flown
It was the moment I made a truce
Between the feather and goose
Come back speaking Spanish
I don't mind

Sky water running off the mountain
Sliding through the light of dusty souls
The feel of what our grows asking the beetle
Of the lonely mocking bird
When you're running off with money man
We all knew there would be no return

That was the moment when the breeze
Stashed across the wicked sees
And came back as the ballad of the pines
Sing it with me if your heart is broken
This is the ballad of the pines
Sing it with me if you're filled with joy

For this is the ballad of the pines
Sing it with your best friends sing it to you
The ballad of the pines
They are scared and their like temples sing it to them

"He was a great balloon maker
The balloons were never known for speed
There's no way you'll get sweet
You asked me to waste some time
Come out to see the sun

But I said I think there's more of them like us
And he said you might be right
We'll find them in time somewhere
I had a dream

For her name was Barbara Allen

For the love of Barbara Allen

To the place she was dwelling
Saying you must come to his deathbed now
If your name be Barbara Allen

Slowly, slowly she got up
Slowly, slowly she came nigh him
And the only words to him she said
Young man I think you're dying

As she was walking o'er the fields
She heard the death bell knelling
And every stroke it seemed to say
Hardhearted Barbara Allen

Oh, mother mother make my bed
Make it long and make it narrow
Sweet William died for me today
I'll die for him tomorrow

They buried him in the choir
And from his grave grew a red red rose
From her grave a green briar

They grew and grew to the steeple top
'Till they could grow no higher

Red rose around green briar

"Now when I was young my

Though they sounded mighty fine they made no sense to me
Now that I am all grown up it seems my nights have changed such
So I went out and made me up a nursery rhyme for me

First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may wish I might 
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle a man with a fiddle and the
Girls sings along with the tune
Just a one more dance til you turn off the lights and 
You can shut down this saloon

Well I never understood 
How a big ole gal could raise no kids in a shoe 
And any old jack that goes jumping a candle 
Needs to find something better to do
Rub a dub dub 3 men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky tonk nursery rhyme 
And it's the only one I'll sing

"Dawn breaks on the battlefield
While the mornin' mist lays heavy on the ground
And the silence is like thunder
As the enemy prepares another round

And her soft satin armor
Lying on the far side of the bed
Wounded and heart broken
And scared by the killin' words I said

I have no rules in battle
So I fire the guns of anger once again
Oh, she's such a little thing
And there's no doubt about it I can win

But with teardrops as her weapon
She easily destroys my battle plan
And in shamefully retreatin', I smile at her
And then she takes command

Oh, what a sweet surrender
I'm captured by two lips so warm and tender
She completely surrounds me with her lovin' arms again
It was love that brought the battle to an end

Now the enemies are lovers once again",Battle,Country
"BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC
Writer Julia Ward Howe

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on. CHORUS: Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on. I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps; They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps, His day is marching on. I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel! ""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal! Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,"" Since God is marching on. He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free! While God is marching on.",Battle Hymn of the Republic,Country
"There's a mighty battle coming and it's well now on it's way
It'll be fought at Armageddon, it shall be a sad, sad day
In the Book of Revelation, words in Chapter 16 say
""There'll be gathered there, great armies for that battle on that day""

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said, ""Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass""
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see
Start with Chapter 24 and read from 1 to 33
In our Savior's blessed words he said on earth, he prophesied
For he spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been trials and tribulations, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said, ""Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass""
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars
Oh, the hearts of been shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth
Those who seek it will receive it, mercy at the Savior's feet

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair

"BATTLE OF LOVE
(George Jones - Darrell Edwards)
Â« Â© '61 Glad Music Â»

(Battle of love)
For over a year I've been in love with a girl so sweet
But the guy next door has declared a war and I won't retreat
He hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
But I'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
We're just beginning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
He was once my friend through thick and thin but now I draw a line
For he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
But I know his plans so I'll take my stand and defend her
He's gonna find that I'm not the kind to surrender
I'm out for winning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
I can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
I know I'm right and ready to fight for my true love
He's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
So I've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
And when they say I do I'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
If he wins her love how I ever learn to live without her
Cause here she is in my arms so why should I doubt her
If I'm really winning this mighty battle of love
I'm really winning this mighty battle of love",Battle of Love,Country
"Years ago grandaddy Baxter gave dad 40 acres
Daddy proudly named it Baxter Hill
Him and Mom raised seven kids
And gave us each 1 acre
In hopes someday that's where we all would build
Daddy's greatest dream in life was Baxter Hill

The rest all moved away but
I stayed on with mom and daddy
But they all gathered in when Mama died
They were quick decidin' papa couldn't handle business
And the six of them all said let's subdivide
You could see them dollar bill signs in their eyes

Yeah, they subdivided daddy's forty acres
The place where him and mama worked and saved
Not out of need, just out of greed
They built them six room houses
Bet mama's turnin' over in her grave
Just knowin' they've done papa this away

Well, they agreed that I could keep
The acre papa gave me
So I left that old house standin' where it was
And just a few days later
Them big old yellow graders
Started pushing up the ground my daddy loved
Tearin' up everything that he'd dreamed of

Now papa didn't say much
He just sat there on the front porch
And watched them big bulldozers rape his fields
He'd look straight ahead
And say I know your mama's dead
But she'll be comin' back to Baxter Hill
And she'll rattle chains in every room they build

Yeah, they subdidvided daddy's forty acres
But the houses stand there empty,cold and still
They sold a few, but the people moved
And swore they'd never come back
Papa just grins and says they never will

In this palm tree paradise
Ambition fades with every wave
For the finer things in life

And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain

Leaves me down and lonely

Patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I
Run away and hide
And I may find in time that
You were always right
You're always right

"The calendar said the 30th day of June
Sinatra had the nation's No 1 tune
The Yanks led the American Leauge by a country mile
And I walked the floor as you gave birth to our first child

And when I thanked you for our first son
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

I don't guess I've ever seen you cry
You saved money until my salvary wouldn't get us by
And it wasn't very long just a couple of years it seemed
We saved enough money and paid down on a five-room dream

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said honey the best is yet to come

Well just think Tony's away to school honey studying law
And do you remember Carrie we voted Queen of the prom that fall
Oh Lord we worked all winter long with Troy and in your mind there's no doubt
Who was the proudest one who was the proudest when he became an Eagle Scout

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

The calendar reads the first day of June
The paper says man has walked on the Moon

And wasn't it fun way back when

Or maybe in a year you'll reappear

I'd throw my arms around you and watch you smile

The very best of sweethearts and became the best of strangers

I never stopped to think that those two lips could also cheat
Your precious love was mine at least that's what I told myself
Until I found you in the arms of someone else
I only saw the happiness I overlooked the dangers
Until the best of sweethearts became the best of strangers
And now they see us in the crowd and think we've never met

"They married back in forty-two
They were young and love was new
And every day that feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad

And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

The fifties came and the sixties went

And they made the most of each day spent

Left with oh so little time

Today I braved the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names

And the pleasure of just growing up

For so long now
I could never turn my back on you
And just walk out

How could I leave you
When you've been so forgiving?
But living without her love
Don't feel like much like living

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Lyin' close beside you
After the love we've made
Another face flickers in my mind
And takes me miles away

I've tried so hard to fight it
But I can't fight anymore
My heart is so divided girl
In this tug of war

Caught between two fires

"Quand on partait de bon matin
Quand on partait sur les chemins

Why avait Francis et Sébastien

Elle avait fait en le suivant
Tous les chemins environnants

On déposait dans les fougères
Nos bicyclettes
Puis on se roulait dans les champs
Faisant naître un bouquet changeant
De sauterelles, de papillons
Et de rainettes

Quand le soleil à l'horizon
Profilait sur tous les buissons

On revenait fourbus contents

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"",  came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,

"My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight

My love is a miles in the waiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns and the pain that would stop
And it's [Incomprehensible]

Leading me on
Leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while on the side

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done

There is no turning back, on the run

Oh with the freeway and the coming of night-time

"Way back in '29 somewhere in Coffeeville

"When I was walking down the street, a billboard caught my eye.
The advertisement written there would make you laugh and cry.
The sign was torn and tattered from the storm the night before,
And as I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes. Drink Wrigley's Spearmint beer.
Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your wife's complexion clear.
Chew chocolate-covered mothballs -- they're sure to satisfy.
Brush your teeth with Lifebuoy soap and watch the suds go by.

When I recovered from the sock, I went along my way.
I'd gone no further than a block, when there to my dismay,
Another billboard caught my eye, just like the one before,
As I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Take your next vacation in a brand-new Frigidaire.
Learn to play piano in your winter underwear. 
Simonize your baby with a Hershey's candy bar,
And see the difference that Drano makes in all the movie stars!

People over 35, take baths in Lipton Tea.

I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""

"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,Country

Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside

Black day in July
Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land

Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found

Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And the people rise in anger
And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops
And the blood begins to spill

Black day in July

In the mansion of the governor
There's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing
And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season

Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake
And everyone is listening
And everyone's awake

Black day in July
Black day in July
The printing press is turning
And the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper
And you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing
Is it him or is it me

Black day in July

In the office of the President
The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in
To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait

Black day in July
Black day in July
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach

Watches all the cars collide

Before they're allowed to be free?

Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?

And yesterday's news
Just give me something
That I can use

My boots are forgiven
The valley's a lie
And all these words talking
Mean nothing tonight

Out on the road
It's a desolate place
But you've been there before

There's a town by the river
It's where I was born
And I died on a hillside
All tattered and torn

We'll be home tonight

Her beauty, it seemed to expand,
Her hair hung down in long tresses,
Tied back with a blue velvet band.

Come back to my old home again.

Every night as I lay on my pillow,
I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band.

Then one night as I lay down dreaming
Of home and poor mother and dad,
Like a flash by my bedside was standing
The form of my Blue Velvet Band.

I started next day for my darling,
Just to go back and make her my bride
But as I reached the old country depot,
They told my my sweet heart has died.

Midst the sweet summer flowers of the land

On her head was a blue velvet band.",Blue Velvet Band,Country

"Some things are basically beyond the vision of doubt
Some things I understand that I'm better off without
Like dingy walls painted clean
Broken words unseen
I said maybe the world's as it should be and you disagreed
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me
Like a wish I sometimes untie 
Wide open spaces and amber waves of grain
That's where I used to live
In the kingdom of my youthful reign
Before I was a prisoner to the silo
Walled into the shadows
Shy to the sky 
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me 
Like a spell I sometimes let fly",Bolder Than Paradise,Country
"Te miro desde arriba por si todo se termina
Quiero que me recuerdes como las primeras veces
Hay algo que no atino a saber por que no camina
Que será lo que no me deja ver lo que tengo enfrente?

Ya no somos pequeños aprendimos de las cosas
Que nos fueron pasando en lugares diferentes
No te vayas al China que alli no tienen cortinas
Como las que nos escondieron de todos los demás

Te mueves sin sombrilla paseando por las orillas
De la isla que encima se enfada cuando no vuelvo
No todo es culpa mia ahora esto es muy diferente
Y si no lo ves es que no lo quieres ver
O es que no me puedes ver

Algo que un día brilla también podrá repertirse
Intentas que me lo crea pero me parece un cuento
Hace 200 días que no me sale una línea y además
No parece que va a cambiar aunque ahora me escuches

Solo yo te pido que te quedes en
Donde puedas alcanzar lo que quieras conseguir
Y en cambio tú me pides que me quede donde puedas
Vigilarme hasta que te canses de buscar",Bombay,Country

"The wind blows hard across the Texas planes
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, “How come you killed that man”
I said, “I don't know why”

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

I met Elvis, Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode

He said son have we got a deal for you
I'm gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too

I'll take your money, I'll make you a movie
But I can tell ya' right now I was born to boogie

"The wind out here's like a cross-cut saw, the land is red and green
The summer sun's hanging in a pale blue sky, the air is sharp and clean
There's a frozen moment in waving grain, food for a hungry world
But we can't clothe ourselves with the check, we can barely feed ourselves

At night I lie awake and worry and the debts go round and round
Furrows in my night time forehead,
And furrows on borrowed ground

There's and old galv shed with a laughing lean, it's kept the tractor dry
I remember the day when we knocked it up with stringy bark and fencing wire
The earthen floor's been beaten hard, where the rain hasn't cut a path
I'm frightened to look because I'm beaten too and the mice run through the chaff

And I lie on my bed, staring into the red 
And the overdraft won't come down
And it's hard work keeping your family together,
Living on borrowed ground

And I don't blame your brother, son, for moving into town
It's no place here for a bright young man,
Living on borrowed ground.

And I watch all the programs on the ABC, 
After the sun's gone down
Lucy Broad's talking on ""Countrywide"",
Talking about borrowed ground.

There's some money-men coming from Sydney who tell me it's only a matter or time.

And she walked to my table to forgive me again

"Once upon a time in the land of Hushabye
Around about the wondrous days of yore
I came across a sort of box
Bound up with chains and locked with locks
And labeled kindly do not touch; it's war
 
Decree was issued 'round about
All with a flourish and a shout
And a gaily colored mascot tripping lightly on before
Don't fiddle with this deadly box, or break the chains, or pick the locks
And please, don't ever play about with war
 
Well, the children understood
Children happen to be good
They were just as good around the time of yore
They didn't try to pick the locks, or break into that deadly box
They never tried to play about with war
 
Mummies didn't either
Sisters, aunts, grannies neither
Cause they were quiet, and sweet, and pretty in those wondrous days of yore
Well, very much the same as now, not the ones to blame somehow
For opening up that deadly box of war
 
But someone did
Someone battered in the lid
And spilled the insides out across the floor
A sort of bouncy, bumpy ball made up of guns and flags 
And all the tears, and horror, and the death that goes with war
 
It bounced right out
And went bashing all about
And bumping into everything and stored
And what was sad and most unfair is that it didn't seem to care who much it bumped
Or why, or what, or for
 
It bumped the children mainly
And I'll tell you this quite plainly
It bumps them every day, and more and more, and leaves them dead and burned and dying
Thousands of them sick and crying
Cause when it bumps, it's really very sore
 
Now, there's a way to stop the ball
It isn't difficult at all
All it takes is wisdom; I'm absolutely sure that we could get it back into the box
And bind the chains and lock the locks
No one seems to want to save the children any more
 
Well, that's the way it all appears
Cause it's been bouncing 'round for years and years

Raise the children now to keep, every virtue that you seek
Hoping one day they'll receive
""We are nothing but the dust that gathers down below the plain
We'll be gone and you'll remain""

Even I get lonely too

Don't really want to causes scene but girl you got everything
And I want your boyfriend
I'm not gonna lie
I'll be his girl when he tells you good bye
Don't worry I won't take him cause I ain't that low
I want your boyfriend just thought you should know
That he and I go back so far oh my gosh we lived in his first truck
First time we heard Shania Twain I think we were on our way to Lubbcock
And I know you think he loves you now
Seen so many girls come in and out
It sounds a bit insensitive
But the truth is what it is
I want your boyfriend
I'm not gonna lie
I'll be his girl when he tells you good bye
Don't worry I won't take him cause I ain't that low
I want your boyfriend just thought you should know, yeah
Don't know why you act so surprised
Can't you see it in his eyes
You must have known it all this time
Yeah
That I want your boyfriend
To tell you the truth I'll be right there when he gets over you
What's meant to be will always find its way in the end

Come into my tenderness
Dream along with me

Listen to the singers shout
Come into my solitude

And left to lie alone

To the daughters that they own
Mothers who don't leave a child
In a single safety zone

People so unhinged

Cold and weary, with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father, you have come
And chosen me now

I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone,
Must I walk this path alone?

If a wiser one one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of your plan

"Tis of a brave young highwayman this story I will tell
His name was Willie Brennan and in Ireland he did dwell
It was on the Kilwood Mountain he commenced his wild career
And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor
Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down
He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried
But still they say that, in the night, some do see him ride
They see him with his blunderbuss, all in the midnight chill
Along, along the King's highway rides Willie Brennan still!",Brennan on the Moor,Country
"Hejsan morsan, hejsan stabben!
Här är brev från älsklingsgrabben.
Vi har kul på kolonien,
Vi bor 28 gangstergrabbar I en...

...stor barack med massa sängar.
Kan ni skicka mera pengar?
För det vore en god gärning
Jag har spelat bort vartenda
Dugg på tärning.

Här är roligt vill jag lova 
Fastän lite svårt att sova 
Killen som har sängen över mig han
Vaknar inte han när han behöver nej.

Jag har tappat två framtänder 
För jag skulle gå på händer
När vi lattjade charader,
Så när morsan nu får se mig får hon spader.

Ute I skogen finns baciller
Men min kompis han har piller
Som han köpt utav en ful typ,
Och om man äter dom blir man en jättekul typ.

Han blir aldrig var han varit, 
För polisen kom och tog hand
Om honom förra veckan när vi lekte skogsbrand.

Ute I skogen finns det rådjur,
I baracken finns det smådjur 
Och min bäste kompis Tage 
Han har en liten fickkniv inuti sin mage.

"You say, too much water
Has gone under the bridge by now.
I say that bridges
Are all that's left for us now.
Each side of the river, the city is burning
There is no turning back.
Oh, what else can I say? There's no loss of face
And nothing's betrayed, there's no disgrace
In meeting on the bridge.

You'll have to trust me, don't bring any,
Any of them so-called friends
And everyone's talking, they soon start shouting
And we all know how that one ends.
You say the daylight, I say the night-time
Let's meet in the twilight zone.
Don't be afraid you'll come to no harm
Nothing's betrayed, we'll both be unarmed
And both of us must come alone.

A Bridge of sighs for the compromise
Does anyone get what they really wish?
A handshake, a heartbreak, maybe a parting with a kiss.
Ah, don't be afraid, there is no disgrace
No one's betrayed, there's no loss of face
In meeting on the bridge.

Repeat chorus

The river runs red, the air is smoking
And the flames burn higher and higher.
The numbers of dead are like beads of sweat
And they can never put out this fire.
The ones who are left must not be swept away
On this river of death, so I'll meet you halfway
There is no disgrace, what more can I say?
There's no loss of face
We must meet on the bridge.",Bridge of Sighs,Country

"My nights were getting better
Without a lover
The feeling of peace I had
All by myself
Free to fill my space with
Things I really wanted
Giving no excuses I even had my own place
Had my own place

Those long nights
Those bright lights
Those carefree days
Those long nights
Those bright lights
I tell you I got it made

Never ever realized that I was lonely
'cause working on the road can be
It can be an escape
Dinner in a one night stop
Just meet me in the hall
Take a number in my black book
And promise to call, promise to call

Those long nights
Those bright lights
Those carefree days
Those long nights
Those bright lights
I tell you I got it made

Then I saw a bright face
Lit by a candle
Sitting in the bar alone
She filled the whole place

The magic of her presence
Who could walk up to her
Who would ever dare to give
This woman-child a chase

Thought my nights were getting better
Just living by myself
But I got hooked this time
Now we got our own place
We got our own place

Those bright lights
Those carefree days

Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music

A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds

And say the job is taking longer that I planned
I don't have the heart to tell her that a stranger's turned me on
And I'm headin' for the broken promise land.

Tonight I'm crossing over and I'll reach the cheatin' side
And I'll hate myself for coming here again
Where the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on lies
A place they call the broken promise land.

Found a note left on the dresser and a key left in the door
On the floor I found her golden wedding band
Guess she finally had to tell me she's not waiting anymore
And she's headin' for the broken promise land.

"I made myself a promise, the day you put me down,
That I wouldn't see you if you came around.
But here you are, within my arms, the way you used to be.
And I broke the promise that I made to me.

They told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go:
I made myself a promise that I'd only say hello.
I knew you'd only hurt me, but it's such sweet misery,
So I broke the promise that I made to me.

A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,
And I know who that someone's bound to be.
And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,
And broke the promise that I made to me.

So I can never tell night from day

Trying not to stare, but you are everywhere

Been hiding, half awake for so long

Been stumbling, half awake for so long

I've got, I've gotta let you go

This morning I walked to the train, just like you did every day
Everyone else is the same, I wonder if you're the same
And do you lay your head in someone else's bed
To help you bury it? Just like you always did
And now you're in all of my words, only way I can return
Memories fade in reverse, but you will always be heard
Wherever I can sing, you'll be right there with me

'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do
'Cause you're so up here, I caught that feeling

Of rocket ships and Mars
Of sunny days,
And Willie Mays,
And chocolate candy bars

Of big green frogs,
And puppy dogs,
And castles in the sand

Your toys will all be gone
Your broomstick horse will ride away,
To find another home
And you'll have grown into a man,
With cowboys of your own
And then you'll have to go to war,
To try and save your home
And then you'll have to learn to hate
You'll have to learn to kill
It's always been that way, my son
I guess it always will

No broomstick gun they'll hand you
No longer you'll pretend
You'll call some man your enemy
You used to call him 'friend'

You'll hear your brothers cry
And through it all you'll wonder

Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the old jukebox up
The song sure was a sad one
A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose
From the pain the song was inflicting
And all at once he jumped to his feet
Just like somebody kicked him

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five

Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breathe

Told him ""Don't play dumb with us, son""
""Know damn well what the charge is.""

"Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long

Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
Spend the summer pleasant
On the trail of the buffalo

I found myself in griffin
In the spring of '83
When a well known famous drover
Come walking up to me

Said, ""How do you do, young fellow
Well, how would you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the trail of the buffalo?""

Well, I being out of work right then
To the drover I did say
""Going out on the buffalo road
Depends on the pay""

If you will pay good wages
And transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the hunt of the buffalo

Of course I'll pay good wages
And transportation too
If you will agree to work for me
Until the season's through

But if you do get homesick
And you try to run away
You will starve to death
Out on the trail and also lose your pay

Well with all his flattering talking
He signed up quite a train
Some 10 or 12 in number
Some able bodied men

Our trip it was a pleasant one
As we hit the Westward road
Until we crossed Old Boggy Creek
In Old New Mexico

There our pleasures ended
And our troubles all began
A lightening storm hit us
And made the cattle run

Got all full of stickers
From the cactus that did not grow
And the outlaws watching
To pick us off in the hills of Mexico

Well, our working season ended
And the drover would not pay
If you had not drunk too much
You are all in debt to me

But the cowboys never had heard
Such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left that drover's bones to bleach
On the plains of the buffalo",Buffalo Skinners,Country

"They used to call me lightening
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yeah

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

She was sittin' on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac Deville
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free ride for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfolded on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it comin'

It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
It makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah

We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke to the sound of sirens and
The sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my 44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
The only thing that's left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Man, bullets filled the air

You never see it comin'
'Til it hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
And the bullets in the gun

Daddy, it's my first ride.""
""I know the cake looks funny,
Daddy, but I sure tried.""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong,
I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning,
And butterfly kisses at night.

Sweet sixteen today,
She's looking like her mamma
A little more every day.
One part woman, the other part girl.
To perfume and makeup,
From ribbons and curls.
Trying her wings out in a great
Big world. but I remember

Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair.
""You know how much I love you daddy,
But if you don't mind,
I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time.""
Oh with all that I've done wrong,
I must have done something right.
To deserve her love every morning,
And butterfly kisses at night.

All the precious time
Ohhh like the wind, when the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

She'll change her name today.
She'll make a promise,
And I'll give her away.
Standing in the bride room
Just staring at her,
She asked me what I'm thinking,
And I said ""I'm not sure,
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl.""
Then she leaned over and gave me

Butterfly kisses, with her mama there
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle daddy, it's just
About time""
""Does my wedding gown look pretty Daddy?""
""Daddy don't cry""
Oh with all that I've done wrong,
I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning,
And butterfly kisses
I couldn't ask god for more, man, this is
What love is
I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always
Remember
Every hug in the morning, and butterfly kisses",Butterfly Kisses,Country

Rings and things and buttons and bows.

Take me where the cement grows

"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt

"What good is sitting, alone in your room?

So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours
The day she died the neighbours
Came to snicker her
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor

But when I saw her laid down like  a queen
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

And as for me 
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea

My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile through these tears dear at you

I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue

Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me

Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you",Cabin of Love,Country

"She kinda breezed into town from New Orleans
And said, ""Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now, I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just come to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me

Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red-hot kiss on his cold blue lips
He started breathin' (aah)

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans
Big Bad John and his Cajun Queen
They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time

got a flight in the morning 
[Peaches] Plleeeasssee? Mac I miss you

It was callin' me back 
[Peaches]mmmm Mac 

Momma told you was no good but you fucked me so good 
I rushin' home from studio session to meet you where ever, no questions 
Tellin' my niggas ""I'm a holla at ya"" 
This camouflage love every other night got me missin' flights 
You started stressin' me 
And you start depressing me 
But before I could leave you alone you start undressing 
And I remember seeing Hickies on your neck 
They wasn't mine I was in Cali on the movie set, baby girl 
what about respect you said you love me when I'm up in them guts 
We tend to say strange thangs when we caught up in them ???
My nigga Fiend was tellin' me you don't deserve me 
But a niggas gone do what he want to do ya heard me 
I'm a let this go by saying you'll always be apart of me 
I just can't answer you when that pussy call me

"It's of a fair and handsome girl, she's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy and it's true that she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him, like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O.

So she bargained with a young sailor boy, it's all for a piece of gold
Straighway then he led her all down into the hold
Saying ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now, when the other sailors heard the news, they fell into a rage
And with all the whole ship's company, they were willing to engage
Saying ""We'll tie her hands and feet me boys, overboard we'll throw her
And she'll never see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now, when the captain he's heard the news, well he too fell into a rage
And with his whole ship's company, he was willing to engage
Saying ""She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her collar shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town, called Canadee-I-O""

Now when they came down to Canada, scarcely above half a year
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now, and she cuts a gallant show
She's the finest of the ladies down in Canadee-I-O

Come all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be
I'd have you follow your own true love when he goes out on the sea
For if the sailors prove false to you, well the captain he might prove true
To see the honour that I have gained by the wearing of the blue",Canadee-I-O,Country

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

"Well I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy. 
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah. 
In sixty-one, I went to the war, 
To win one for Virginia! 
Ya my brother went first and they called me to. 
I was green as clover in the morning dew. 
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune. 
Carry me back to Virginia! 

Fire in the cannon, water in the well, 
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell. 
I learned right quick how to march like hell and affix that bayonet. 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

With a sword and a saddle, 
Powder in the gun. 
We thought for a minute our fight was done. 
So they lined us up to the metals arm, 
And hammered us into the quicksand. 
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire, 
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron. 
Til the men took cover where the horses piled, 
Then we shivered and then hold against them. 

But the war raged on like flames of hell, 
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell, 
Dressed in rags and we ate that grass 
When they cut off our legs we cried! 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

And they died in the valley, 
Died in the swamp, 
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped. 
Died in the ditches, 
Died in the fields, 
In the belly of a wagon for a woman's to heal 
Died in the war, 
Starved in the camps. 
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man. 
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend 
And to bury the tome of a-dixieland! 

Down in Alabama, 
Down in Caroline, 
Way down in Gerogie, on the Tennesee line. 
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee, 
Now we want to go home to Virginia. 
Say we want to go home to Virginia!

"Beside my bed there is a lamp
And in that lamp there is a lonely moth
He’s got one night, he’s got one life
And one thing on his mind, and that’s the fire

He doesn’t care from where it comes
He only knows he’s got to run
Toward the brightest promise in his eye
Now he’s circling to the ground
His wings have burned, he’s falling down
I just watch, and wonder how we carry on

It was a world I never made
I just fell into this old parade
They told me it’s my time to shine
And they got ways to light me up at night

They didn’t care from where I came
It seemed they lost their pride and shame
Looking for a fire of their own
One last ember hits the ground
The wood’s all burned, it's ashes now
If you look up to the moon, you’ll help me carry on

Old man in a bar tonight
He sits down on a stool to watch the fight
He says “One last drink to light me up
And then I do believe I’ve had enough”

Chasing dreams that end in pain
I’ve chased the sun, I’ve chased the rain

I feel the moon behind the clouds

Infinity gives me chills
So could the waters of Iceland
But there's a difference in finding diamonds in rust
And rhinestones in a dishpan
Miracles bowl me over
And often will they do so
Now I think I was asleep till I heard
The voice of the great Caruso

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

A friend of mine gave me a tape
She'd copied from a record disc
It was made at the turn of the century
And found in a jacket labeled ""misc.""
And midst cellos, harps, and flugelhorns
With the precision of a hummingbird's heart
Was the lord of the monarch butterflies
One-time ruler of the world of art

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Yes, the king of them all was Enrico
Whose singular chest could rival
A hundred fervent Baptists
Giving forth in a tent revival
True he was a vocal miracle
But that's only secondary
It's the sould of the monarch butterfly
That I find a little bit scary

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Perhaps he's just a vehicle
To bear us to the hills of Truth
That's Truth spelled with a great big T
And peddled in the mystic's booth
There are oh so many miracles
That the western sky exposes
Why go looking for lilacs
When you're lying in a bed of roses?

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

"Se ha formado un casamiento
Todo cubierto de negro
Negros novios y padrinos
Negros cuñados y suegros
Y el cura que los casó
Era de los mismos negros

Cuando empezaron la fiesta
Pusieron un mantel negro
Luego llegaron al postre
Se sirvieron higos secos
Y se fueron a acostar
Debajo de un cielo negro

Y allí están las dos cabezas
De la negra con el negro
Amanecieron con frío
Tuvieron que prender fuego
Carbón trajo la negrita
Carbón que también es negro

Algo le duele a la negra
Vino el médico del pueblo
Recetó emplasto de barro
Pero del barro más negro
Que le dieron a la negra
Zumo de maqui de cerro

Ya se murió la negrita
Que pena p´al pobre negro
La echó dentro de un cajón
Cajón pintado de negro,
No prendieron ni una vela
Ay, qué velorio más negro",Casamiento de Negros,Country
"(Cassie Cassie) the first time I saw Cassie she was running through a meadow
With a handful of daffodils she picked somewhere nearby
Awed by her beauty I watched her as she ran
She looked like an angel against the summer sky
I loved her through the summer our hearts were gay and free
We loved with a love that was more than love she was just a part of me
I'd often look at her and think she's too good to be true
She was so far above all the other things I knew
Through Cassie's lips there only asked words of loove and kindness
She could see so far beyond other's faults and blindness
One morning without warning I awoke and she was gone
Perhaps she was an angel and she flew away home
Now I run through the meadow hoping that she'll hear me
Although I cannot see her now I feel she's somewhere near me
I call her name so loudly I awaken from my sleep
To find that I've just dreamed again of this girl so kind and sweet

"As a child, I was terrified of the mighty ocean
When I heard the distant urging of the brine
Though I cried at night as I tried to fight the emotion
That bitter cup of tears was truly mine

But when I came to taste the spray on the waterfront
I lost my fear and shrugged away my shame
And I stowed away on a trans-atlantic freighter
With the tempest raging in my every vein

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
I'll cast away and take my chance at sea

There were stormy days and roaring nights a-plenty
In the salty fellowship of boys and men
They were tough and true, they were glassy eyed and reckless
With a blazing thirst, I drank and drank again

We crossed the line, explored the depths of danger
Exceeding every fantasy and dream
No landsman with his stifling horizons
Could ever guess the wonders we had seen

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
I'll cast away and take my chance at sea
I've braved the waves in an open boat and I know these waters well
I'll man your lifeboat any time you need

Way, castaway from the restless aching
Way, castaway, gonna leave it all behind
Way, far away where the waves are breaking
Way, far away where the ocean meets the sky

Well a ship must tack and a man must follow his compass
On an unknown shore I foundered in the sand
Met a salty girl with a sailor's gait and her eyes were a greeny blue
And she knew the ropes like the back of her sunburned hand

We danced a hornpipe on the beach to the sound of the seething swell
We drank and sank exhausted on the strand
Till I slipped my anchor, quit my ship and became a castaway
To savor the embrace of her native land

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
A man may marry and still put out to sea
We brave the waves in our open boat and we know these waters well
We'll man your lifeboat any time you need

"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”

“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

For the Paradise that we did seek,
Was noted for the weak,
There was some with the natives.

I promise that we'll never part.
To him I'll be true, there'll be no one new
From now, till death do us part.

Do you take this woman to be your wife?

Yes, I'll take this woman.  She'll be mine forever.
And I'll love her with all of my heart.
To have and to hold, our love won't grow cold.
I promise.  Till death do us part.

We'll take each other, from this day forward, 
Together in sickness or health.
United with love, we'll face life together,
If we're poor or if we have wealth.

For better or worse, you'll always come first 
And no one can keep us apart.
Yes, we'll take each other, forsaking all others.

Was a day I feared growing old
Many times have come

You would follow me
All the time
And everywhere I go?

And what I got to know
Is it still the same?
