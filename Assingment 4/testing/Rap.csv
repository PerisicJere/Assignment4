"Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smoking dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puff
sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, fully decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted
While I'm entertaining, wild ain't it
How me and mugs, I hang with Hannibal Lector (Hot Shit)
So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud wha
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause
I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw
I'm ""Born to Mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamor
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar B's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
F*ck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game then the Bulls and Sonics

Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Who say pretty boys can't be wild niggas
Loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga
How nigga, ask me again it's going down nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown nigga
Pound nigga, what you be givin' when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talkin' shit when I leave the town nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo third question like hey I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma'
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town
K.C. Motown to Alabama
L-A, New York Yankee niggas to Hotlanta, Louisiana
All my niggas wit Country Grammar
Smokin' blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill like I'm Hammer

Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Let's show these cats to make these milli-ons
So you niggas quit acting silly, mon
My ""Kid"" quicker than ""Billy"", mon
Talking really and I need it mon, foes I keep filly mon
'Specially off Remi, mon, keys to my Beemer, mon
Holla at Beenie Man, see me, mon
Cheifin rollin deeper than any mon, through Jennings mon
Through you-City back up to Kingsland, wit nice niggas
Sheist niggas, who snatch yo life nigga, trife niggas
Who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga, ice nigga
All over close to never sober
From broke to havin dough, 'cause my price Range is Rover
Now I'm knockin like Jehovah
Let me in now, let me in now

"Kick it!

You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
You ask you mom, please?, but she still says, no!
You missed two classes, and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

You gotta fight for your right to party

Your pop caught you smoking, and he said, no way!
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (bust it!)

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home is you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, what's that noise?
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!

You gotta fight for your right to party

"Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube, 
And Eazy motherfuckin E

Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothin but the truth so help your black ass?

You god damn right!

Well won't you tell everybody what the f*ck you gotta say?

F*ck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
F*ck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
HUH, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say

[Chorus]
F*ck the police
F*ck the police
F*ck the police
F*ck the Police

Pull your god damn ass over right now
Aww shit, now what the f*ck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the f*ck up
Man, f*ck this shit
Aight smart ass, I'm takin' your black ass to jail!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony 
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

F*ck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in 
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin, ""F*ck you punk!""
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'm a f*ck you up!
Make you think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as f*ck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as f*ck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police, would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a f*ck to say
 
[Chorus]

Yeah man, what you need?
Police, open now
Aww shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em
(Move motherfucker, move now!)
What the f*ck did I do, man what did I do?
Just shut the f*ck up
And get your motherfuckin' ass on the floor
(You heard the man, shut the f*ck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man just shut the f*ck up!

Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin jackin
Sweatin my gang, while I'm chillin in the shack, and
Shinin the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waitin to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin this is what I'll say
 
[Chorus]

The verdict
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, 
White bread, chicken shit motherfucker
But wait, that's a lie!  That's a god damn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the f*ck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
F*ck you, you black mother fuckers!

Why'all be hearin on the radio-

"Was Showbiz interessant macht 
Ist nicht nur das Leute-kennenlernen 
Sondern zu betrachten 
Wie sich Leute plötzlich ändern, 
Wie zum Beispiel die phantasielosesten Wesen 
Auf einmal Phantasie entwickeln
Wenn sie über einen reden.
So erfahr' ich Sachen über mich
Die ich selber nicht gewusst habe.
Hab gehört, ich rasier meine Beine und Brusthaare.
Hab gehört, ich hätte Crewnamen plus Initialen
In Gothic-Lettern tätowiert auf meinen Genitalien.
Hab gehört, ich sei nicht HipHop,
Ich scheiß auf Rapmusik,
Schmeiß mir Ecstasy,
Schreibe Styles auf Technobeats.
Hab gehört, dass ich nix anderes als dissen kann.
Hab gehört, ich stifte die Jungend zum Kiffen an.
Hab gehört, ich hätte die Allüren eines Superstars.
Hab gehört, ich hätte Beef mit Kool Savas.
Würde Im Ernstfall vor 'nem Battle den Schwanz einziehen,
Achja: angeblich hab' ich sogar Beef mit ganz Berlin. [Ui! ]
Ich hab gehört, dass ich in Liedern immer nur dasselbe sage,
Hab gehört, dass ich tagsüber nackt in der Elbe bade.
Hab gehört, ich rap' nicht mehr, hätt' nur aufs Geld gewartet.
Viele meinen sogar, dass ich zu oft dasselbe sage.
Hab gehört, ich wurd auf der Straße gesehen,
Beim Schlafen Im Gehen, [Gähnen]
Weil ich aus Langeweile anfing, Schafe zu zählen.
Ich hab gehört, man soll nicht alles glauben, was Leute erzählen
Denn die Meisten labern zu viel Scheiße.

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?
Ich hab gehört, ich hätte ausgesorgt und sei schon reich.
Wenn das so ist, dann wieso sagt mir meine Bank nicht Bescheid?

Ich hab gehört, dass ich eigentlich Sachse wär
Und nur nach Hamburg gezogen, weils gerade so abgeht hier.

Hab alles gehört, vom größten Kompliment zum schlimmsten Diss,
Von der höchsten Prominenz bis zu den jüngsten Kids.
Wurd verglichen mit allen möglichen Rappern der Szene,
Hab gehört, ich sei cooler als diese und besser als jene
Aber nicht so DEEP wie er und nicht so tight wie ER -
Erzählt das jemand anders, ich will diesen Scheiß nicht hör'n.
Ich finde mich selbst am besten, da kann kommen, wer will,
Deren Promoplatten landen in meinem Sondermüll.
Also, hört bitte auf, die und mich zu vergleichen,
Denn mein Level zu Rapp'n ist für DIE nicht zu erreichen.
Zurück zum Thema:
Ich hab gehört, früher war ich viel beliebter.
Hab gehört, dass ich's nicht real gekeept hab.
Und mit dem Untergrund hätte ich's mir verscherzt -
Jetzt mal ganz unter uns, Jungs: es bricht mir das Herz.
So wie's aussieht ist jeder mal auf mich wütend gewesen,
Fühlte sich von irgendetwas auf die Füße getreten [Au! ].
Es heißt, ich hätte vor, bald in Bayern Im Süden zu leben
Und hör dann auf, Tüten zu drehen und darüber zu reden.
Ich hörte, ich sei in der nächsten Staffel von Big Brother,
Denn die brauchen 'nen zum Trend passenden HipHopper.
Ich hab gehört, man soll nicht alles glauben, was man hört
Denn die Meisten reden zu viel Scheiße.

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?
Ich hab gehört, ich hätte ausgesorgt und sei schon reich.
Wenn das so ist, dann wieso sagt mir meine Bank nicht Bescheid?

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?

Ich hörte, ich sei nicht mehr down mit Dynamite und Tropf.
Wenn das so ist, dann woher kommen dann die Beats aus Deiner Box?",.Hab' Gehört.,Rap

You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Now they 'bout nothin' if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid

I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

Talk to 'em B, if I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody was me
Yeah, break it down for 'em
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could've been
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us

And I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be

Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal

Got me thinking just too much
I want to set it off, but

It's this one thing that's got me trippin'

This one thing my soul may be feeling

It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing don't want to admit it
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh oh oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

Maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
I can't deny, tired of trying
Open up the door, but just keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

Suicide it's a suicide
Budabuyby
Suicide it's a suicide

So you want to die, commit suicide
Dial 1-800-Cyanide line
Far as life, yo it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it

The trick didn't work
Your life was f***ed up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no f***ing reason

And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw

Back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
BZZZZZT touched the third rail.
You f***ed up chicken, now you just got fried
Cause it's a suicide

[Chorus]

Hey you little rich kid, what's your beef?
Come and tell the Grym Reaper all of your grief
You asked for a Benz and you only got a Jeep
Your pop's got endz, but yo he's mad cheap

Maybe you're a bastard child you think
Mom and dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man

Now you stand on the grave digga locked and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
Not
You don't want to live no more

I guess you're really ready for the grave yard tour
When you get home just fill up your windows and you doors
Turn your oven on high for about four hours
Light you a blunt, kiss your a** goodbye
You ga**ed yourself 'cause it's a suicide

I've said it before and I'll say it again
Life moves pretty fast
If you don't stop and look around every once in a while

Verse Three: Prince Rakeem/Ryzarector
Six f***ing devils stepped up playing brave God
Had the f***ing nerve to try and enta my grave yard

I'm the Ryzarector, be my sacrifice
Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced
Stuck a water hose in his mouth at full blast so his head can explode
Second said hmmmm that's good but I can top it

Put an ax up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug, overdose on a drug

Wet your hair stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor set your balls on fire
Better yet go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into spell and

Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in a lion's den
Number Five said it ain't worth being alive
Smoked a dust suede, mixed it with cynaide
The only one to escape was number Six

He went home
Sat in the tub and slit his wrists

Don't come round' talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg
I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you, FF Imperial 'til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti f*ck boy material 'til I'm dead, I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
It's gone, word, boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I'm bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS'ing, no hable ingles
If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who, my team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos

"She
She doesn't need it but she won't try
Try to release it
Cause she thinks she'll die
Depending on it for it she'll lie
It's only a 10 minute high
Eyes
That witnessed a father beat on a mother
Witnessed a system take away her only brother
No one ever said that they loved her
She used to shut her eyes and make the pain subside
But now she's got her 

10 minute high
Just for a little while
She's queen of all the skies
If a hid is bad another one she can buy
Everybody tells her to stop
She would try
But nobody gave her a good reason why

Time has taken it's toll
She looks too old for seventeen
The girl is much too bold
Her heart is cold
When it used to be of gold
Her future has no chance to unfold
She's used her body to get her ways
Is she ashamed of the games she's played
But her best defense is to block out all the pain
But first she buys her

10 minute high
Just for a little while she's floating through the sky
What's she gonna do when she no longer can fly
Is she gonna land on her feet or come down to die
Or is she gonna just break down and cry

When she comes down it all becomes too clear
She knows that someday she should face her fears
But with a touch of reality and over the years
She's forgotten how it feels to be real
It's early morning quiet is the street
She lays in silence the cold cement beneath her feet
She passed away and today's her eighteenth birthday
And all she's left me to say is

She just had her last 10 minute high
Did she contemplate that it would take away her life
She probably knew but she had no reason to fight
There is not a breath on her lips not even a sigh
If only she had known wrong from right
If only she had known
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, girl
Goodbye, bye",10 Minute High,Rap

I mean, we gotta get together - marry yourself, man
'cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself
Know what I'm sayin'
Go marry yourself, go on a honeymoon - treat yourself
I mean, 'cause can't nobody cheat on theyself
You gon' be with yourself, but you can't cheat on yourself

"Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like
Why a nigga can’t live? Get this money, f*ck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100

Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me, while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

And the paramedics wont come even if you scream for help
Dont let love die, you regroovin’ yourself

Nala kann schon reden, wie die Jahre doch vergehen
Sie will wissen, wo ich heut bin
Single, gerade keine Freundin
Alexa, spiel mir „Jocelyn“
Immer da, wo meine Boys sind
Im Studio und trinken bisschen Henny wie mit neunzehn
Yeah, sie wollen wissen wie es schmeckt
Ich sag': „Komm und setz dich zu uns, denn die Tische sind gedeckt“
Ich fühl' mich grad wie Pablo, mach' im Business so viel Cash
Aber Carlo, bitte, bitte, bitte, bitte bleib echt
Check, jeder meiner Schritte war perfekt
Nehm' die Clique mit an die Spitze, doch mein Blick dabei relaxt
Ich will nie wieder frieren, ich hab' Hitze im Gepäck
Und sobald es kalt wird, buch' ich mir 'n Ticket und bin weg, yes

Ich pack' die Fam in mein Spaceship
Wir fliegen hoch, wo es hingeht, weiß man nicht
Ja, es war 'n guter Tag, alle happy
Noch 'n Zug vom Spliff, noch 'n Schluck Henny
Wir blasen Rauch ausm Fenster
Und sehen die Sonne, wie sie langsam untergeht
Alles, was ich weiß, wo wir waren, wo wir sind
Erinner' mich genau, wie das alles anfing
Ich pack' die Fam in mein Spaceship
Wir fliegen hoch, wo es hingeht, weiß man nicht
Ja, es war 'n guter Tag, alle happy

Und sehen die Sonne, wie sie langsam untergeht

Alles echt, echt ist alles, was ich mach'
Zieh' nochmal am Spliff, lehn' mich zurück und hebe ab

Ich pack' die Fam in mein Spaceship
Wir fliegen hoch, wo es hingeht, weiß man nicht
Ja, es war 'n guter Tag, alle happy
Noch 'n Zug vom Spliff, noch 'n Schluck Henny
Wir blasen Rauch ausm Fenster
Und sehen die Sonne, wie sie langsam untergeht
Alles, was ich weiß, wo wir waren, wo wir sind
Erinner' mich genau, wie das alles anfing
Ich pack' die Fam in mein Spaceship
Wir fliegen hoch, wo es hingeht, weiß man nicht
Ja, es war 'n guter Tag, alle happy
Noch 'n Zug vom Spliff, noch 'n Schluck Henny

"J'arrive, je fous la merde comme en concert
Et je me jette dans la foule comme un rocker
Morceau lourd, pas comme Ramzy
Fous la merde vas-y, Gros, c'est les rhamé
C'est rhami (c'est les tontons, c'est chaud)
Les murs transpirent, enlève ton T-Shirt, Mani
On te mets à poil comme au 421, au casino ou
Miami rhinami, l'ami (comme si de rien n'était)
Ghetto comme à Harlem quand on se ramène 
En prison, rends fous les matons
Si t'es en auto accompagne ce son à coups de klaxon
Les gyrophares de keufs en guise de spots
Des scènes à immortaliser sur caméscope
A tous les étages de ta tour 
Un son à te faire griller les feux 
Sécher les cours comme Miss France 2001 
Délire bonhomme Hors limite à te faire 
Rentrer à l'aube roule-toi un gros fumigène 
C'est le sexe desserre les fesses 
Même si tu squattes les bancs jusqu'à en 
Avoir la marque sur les fesses 
Même les Foufs sont de mèche 
Fous la merde et garde la pêche

113 fout la merde
113 fout la merde
113 fout la merde
113 fout la merde!

J'arrive je fous la merde comme au Parc des Princes
Avec mon staff comme Guy Roux on est tous des pinces
Mouvements de foule de fous
«Ouais, tout à fait» comme dirait Thierry
Relou ou Jean Michel Claqué 
113 l'équipe t'entends par les murs qui tremblent?
C'est comme le 15 de France dans ta chambre
C'est michto, re-cui,501, boule-à-zéro
Y a plus de cheveux qui frisent comme Rocheteau
Oh poto fous la merde comme aux puces
Ou comme aux heures de pointe dans le bus
Ou comme au studio quand on bosse
Bouge la tête jusqu'au torticolis
Même grippé et malade on te sort du lit

Si t'es en discothèque, rentre dans le tas
Lève le doigt en l'air, fais le grand écart comme Travolta
Si tu vois flou et que tu rentres saoul
Lève la cuvette et comme Tiger Woods vise bien le trou
9.4 FM de la P-Funk à la soul
Et de suite, ton salon se transforme en saloon
Rim-K, Ap, Mokobé, le 113 fout la merde

113 fout la merde

113 fout la merde

We at it again

Ok, I got my bathin' apes, check, outfit, check
No need to iron, might need to iron
Wit these jewels on, it?s likely they'll be iron
Ask mami dancin' beside me if she ridin'

Or what she sippin' on, mink got my fitted on
She somethin' vivid on, we came to get it on
Came to get it on, drink a lil' here
Everybody throw a drink in the air
It's goin' down, come on

I stepped in da party like whoa
What's da deal wit it? Ain't no hands in da air unless it's a drink wit it
Honeys lovin' 'cus they know I rock da bells in here
Thugs wit me 'cus they know I roll wit Kells and dem

Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
And I'm glad I brought my ass to the right party

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no going home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Stack my chips, make dem hits and
I can tell that y'all love my shit
And got my shirt off, wit my Timbs on
Here all night so you know it's going on

Mami shake it like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a tangerine
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
Glad I brought my ass to the right party tonight

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

No more excuses, now in the two doors exclusive
And everything is all inclusive
We can do it all if my boys included
On da phone wit her friends invite 'em all, let's do this

Get things juicy, it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty
New Kells playing feelin' on yo' booty

Keys to the Ferrar, leave in the garage
Starts wit a massage, ends wit ménage
Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m., gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m., on my way to the tel
But then around six, same thing, different chick
XL mag, perfect fit, now to the bridge, let's go

Baby showin' me all these crazy things
Got me nibblin' on her belly ring
'Bout to get into the swing of things
She keep rubbin' againist my swinga thing

We off up in the other room so hot
Shorty's about to take off that pink tank top
All I wanna say is, shorty drop it like it's hot
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up

"I walked in the place very big space 
Every kind of race dancin' and niggas made chase 
A very pretty face  feel the bass 
Basses kick  flygirl jumps on my tip 

The drink that I sip implies this it it 
She looked to be about 26 I ain't dizzy 
It's time to get busy!! 
Welcome female is in my arms. 

Overwhelmed by my playboy charms 
We jumped in the ride rushed to the crib 
I ain't gotta explain what we did 
Built to last I simply waxed that 

Ax the question, no need for guessin' 
Hey baby, how old are you? 
21 24 maybe 22 

I'm twenty five 

She shucked and kinda neeghed 

And said, ""hee, hee, hee I'm only 13"" 

13!! I need a quick escape 

That's statutory rape 

But she was GOOD! 

Chorus: 

GOOD! 

(You should been there she was) 

GOOD! 

(Man that jail term won't be) 

GOOD! 

(But she looked) 

GOOD! 

(Man her brothers will beat you ) 

GOOD!! 

(Even if I get beat down it was still) 

GOOD!! 

The story gets better, This girl is kinda clever 

She said, ""I want to be with you forever"" 

I said, ""Forget it I need to get my life in order 

You could almost be my daughter"" 

She started sighin' and her sighin' turns into cryin' 

Her cryin' turns into her replyin' 

""Where's the phone?. I think it's time that I went home"" 

She called her pops and said, ""Come get me I'm all alone 

I'm sorry daddy I slept with an older man"" 

He said, ""Don't worry. The 45 is in my hand. 

I'll be there before you count to four."" 

One two three four 

He's at my door 

She said, ""See what you did you caused me all this grief. 

Your goin' to jail my daddy's a police chief. 

If I can't have you no one will. 

And I ain't even on the pill."" 

But you was 

Chorus: Repeat 6x 

GOOD!! 

Daddy walked in and the whole scene kinda changed 

He grabbed his daughter and almost beat the girl insane 

She's cryin' down the hall and now goin' home 

He closed the door and, ""I'm happy we're all alone 

Jump on the bed and look me straight into my eyes 

I think your kinda cute, don't make me use my 45"" 

Daddy's lookin' for a lubricant 

He pulled out a little piece of gum and started chemwin' it 

He said, ""For year I've been lookin for a big strong man 

I've got an apartment out in Brooklyn 

Only my daughter and I live there 

You can see my daughter anytime, anywhere 

But it's you that I want to be mine 

The price tag is your behind 

Don't worry it'll be 

Chorus: 

GOOD!! 

The morale of this story? 

There is no morale you finish the story for me 

When your livin' your life everyday in the hood 

Wakin' up in the mornin' should feel

Push through the city in an all pearl Rover
One day I want to be just like my nigga Hova
But they don't want to let me be

Sayin what I can't be
But I'm a stay up on they bumper

Having your girl screaming just to take a picture
I'm settin up my features
My bank account's reachin
And everybody's peeking

These guys I grew up havin crazy admiration for
Got the feelin that I'm trying replace them
But that ain't the case
I'm in a whole 'nother place
Trying build my estate
I gotta keep my Nike's nice and clean
Keep the women up to 25 chasing me
Got Mr. Davis pushin buttons in the Captains seat
That means more dough before I'm too old
That they seen before

Hey yo Mario!
Don't let em get you heated homie
Just only go harder
Let em underestimate you like you Antonio Tarver
Plus the dudes that be hating is as old as your father
You got plenty time, you gone get plenty shine
I don't pay 'em any mind
They been trying critcize
But you can't live your life through another nigga's eyes
I'm the best and you young boys know so
I'mma fall back and let my young boy blow, let's go

You can tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers, 
'Cause he's got a tech nine in the bushes 

And that's how the shit was handled, 
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J, 
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessey, 
Robs with a mother fucker named O.E.
E had a bitch and her name was Gin, 
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though, 
'Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E&J knew tonight they'd come 
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and rum
The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary, 
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body, 
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi 
E and J told Jack the hotel, 
So Jack tried to bail Juice out of the jail
But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout, 
So Jack shot the judge up and rolled Juice out
Now everybody's talking 'bout Gin and Juice, 
Juice shot Gin 'cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me, 
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey 
Mickey was big, he only sold 8 balls, 
Had ninety nine niggas up against the wall 
E and J found out he made the call 
So E&J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill, 
Got the money from the bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive, 
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt forty five 
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word, 
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice, 
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof, 
Check it out

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird, 
Time for the Hurricane he said word
Thunderbird in an alley waitin', 
Wearin' a beanie, tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird?s top, 
Spilled his drank and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all, 
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' 8 balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill, 
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill 
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks, 
The murderous cop killer Mr Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops 
And it made Mr Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train, 
Didn't know his wife Champagne would never see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45, 
Gotta peel his cap before the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train 
All the boys said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast, 
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him, 
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover, 
And Jack was mad be 'cause Mickey shot his lover 
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced, 
He couldn't hang with the 1-8-7 proof
Juice was splattered and St. Ides had took a fall, 
And then Endo smoked 'em all

1970, 1970

Naci un dia de junio
Del año 77
Planeta mercurio
Y el año de la serpiente
Sin o patente
Tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
Marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar
Sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana Maria
Si seria el primer llanto
Que me probaría
Quemando las heridas
Y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto
Construyendo cada efecto
Correcto, incorrecto, sé aprender todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas
Queran el daño
Subir peldaño
Toma tiempo toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban
Y el invierno en gran verano
Papa me regalo bajo mi insistenso
Juego, trataba de culparte y recibencia
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando senti mi primera impotencia

1977 no me digan no
Que uno lo presiente
Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

Mi adolescencia
Fue una etapa bizarra
El cuerpo es batería
Y la cabeza guitarra
La orquesta narronato
Nada quebrada para la mirada
De una niña que solo talla espadas
Hormona disparada
Sobre poblada sin formas
En que cambian temporadas
Caminas en crucijadas
Cada cual es su morada
Preparaba la carnada
La sagrada diablada
De mirada encabronada
Mi fila la verdad
Nunca busco su silla
Mi búsqueda fue mero
Proceso de pura pila
Pupila de poeta
Que marco nuestra saliba
En la cordillera que miraba la salida
La parada militar de paso monótono
Colores policromolos
Uniformes de poco tono
Detono mi cuestionamento
La voz si sonó no
Mi primera rima que sonó
Y me enrrolo
Mi búsqueda no fue para mi cosa de escenario
Fue algo necesario
Que marcaba ya mi fallo
Así que todas
Mas de lo necesario
Fue cuando entendí
Que todos quieren ser corsario

Vengo al mondo d’estate 
Dio mi parla nel sonno 
Mi dice “scusi, quanto state?” 
Ho il permesso di soggiorno 
Sono nuovo da queste parti 
Parto ma non so se torno 
Non stare sveglio ad aspettarmi 

Questo è l'anno dei miracoli 
Craxi mangia coi tentacoli 
Muore Berlinguer 
Maradona è al Napoli 
Io sempre col pallone in mano 
Sette su sette 
Piedi nudi sull’asfalto fra le vie strette 
L’anno in cui la Apple prova 
Il primo Mac, Crystal Ball 
Crystal meth vado sulle croci tipo Cristotech 
Cozze crude col limone dinastia di pescatori 
Mio padre non fa il buttafuori ma ti pesta fuori 
Rinchiusi dentro il bunker a fumarle tutte 
Niente router, no computer 
Pezzi di ricambio per gli scooter 
Fermo il tempo che scorre, con quel sole risorge 
Soffio sull’occhio di George Orwell 
I primi drin Fossil solo film sui mostri 
Le prime donne stuprate da Bill Cosby 
Cresco in fretta, parlo poco, sembro autistico 
L’arte è cibo per la mente, frequento l’artistico 
Se il treno passerà una volta sola, sarò di parola 
Dopo scuola lascerò il mio nome sopra con il viola 
E tu che aspetti in coda e guardi la firma se cola 
Mi hai visto nascere e morire per rifarlo ancora 
Olbia city, motorino sempre in due 
Poi la vita è diventata più veloce: ognuno per le sue 
È una gara senza freni, non ci sono premi 
Dove cazzo vai se non sai da dove vieni

No-me, no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah! ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Oh, ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me
Oh, ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me

Coprimi di soldi Jerry Maguire 
È quello che hai pensato quando eri nei guai 
Voglio portarti via con me tipo Macdrive 
Back in the days bra Marty Macfly

La mia zona era la z b, heavy metal kids 
La versione beta dell’MC
Ho fatto i peggiori lavori per ripagarmi i CD 
Sognando un futuro migliore, tipo questo qui
In 5 sul Volkswagen dell’Ottantaquattro verso Londra 
È un po’ come nuotare verso l’onda 
Sono affogato e poi resuscitato sulla sponda insomma 
Ho perso quando ho fatto a pugni contro l’ombra 
Dalle esperienze impari, spali merda a quintali 
E anche se mi spari, c'ho la pelle come i cinghiali 
Sardo come Zedda Piras ho fatto il viaggio in ketamina 
Adesso riempio i locali e parcheggio in terza fila 
Sapere che il mio primo disco 
Ha fatto la storia ma dopo il Sangue Misto 
Ancora scioccato per quanto sangue ho visto 
Il mio flow vi ha benedetto, il sangue di cristo 
2012 alla svolta 
Machete crew guarda le spalle tipo la scorta 
Capo come John Gotti, sveglio tutte le notti 
Vivevo in una casa con il bagno di Trainspotting 
Poi la mia passione è diventata professione 
Devozione, mani intrecciate come alla confessione 
Ringrazierò la sorte per gentile concessione 
È importante ciò che lasci, non la conclusione

Ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah! ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me 
Ah, ora tutti sanno il no-me

Vengo al mondo d’estate 
Dio mi parla nel sonno 
Mi dice “hey boy, guarda che ora tutti sanno il 
No-me, no-me, no-me"" 
Ah? ora tutti sanno il no-me, no-me, no-me

Peepin' out the window with an AK
Pullin' up on these coppas 
Helicoptas, squad cars, squat 10's with choppas
They tellin' me ""nigga, get the f*ck out before ya die
If you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry""
Should I kick open the door and go to war
Or should I stick my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a f*ck you note
Hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin'
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They want to put me back up in the nut house again
But I'm not goin' back and take my Prozac
They can keep the straight jacket
And leave a straight mothafuckin' jack

Crazy niggas still bangin' and slangin' crack
To the death, when the game put 'em up on they back
Muthafuckas catchin' names, from shootin' high
And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block
And I ain't changed much, hell
I'm still smokin' four or five mothafuckin' choppas before it's twelve
Muthafuckas think they know me, but they don't know
I'm sellin' first class tickets to the murda show

Playa hata's gettin' hung up like a jury
So peep the game from an old school G you know so well
The east bay gangsta, leaving caution tape and faces pale
I bails on a full moon like the 12 o clock 
Neighborhood watch scared to look and see who on the block
Just fed a rally's, no po-po come around here

I swear you do it to me everytime

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate? 
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your rear section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's malik my hobby's putting mc's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real mc's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital tribe nigga, what? 
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me slick tip the ruler

Oh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on, on and on and on
On and on and on

Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat wheat chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
'Cause tonight, we gettin off like o. j
And yo I got a dawg that bites, f*ck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most mc's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have mc's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
'Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the linden boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

I'm hearing shooters loading pistols while I'm brushing my teeth
I get so many death threats it's getting normal to me
But I bend don't break, I don't ask just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night I had a dream some killers ran in my room
Trying to be patient but nigga I can't wait
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em I can't say
You either with me, or against me, or you in my way
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree but hell I don't breed 'em
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was down right evil
Is it karma coming back to me, so much drama
My own mama turned her back on me, and that's my mama
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later still don't know shot up my Hummer

Wisdom that I speak leavin niggas stiff frozen

So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down

'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key 
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me 
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins 
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support 
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean 
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart 
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one 
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

Wir werden hier bestehen, lass es geschehen
Auch wenn die Winde eisig sind
Bei Nacht wird man uns aus der Ferne sehen
Und hören wie unser Lied erklingt
Himmlische Wege
Sie führen uns aus dem Tal
Erteil' deine Pflege
20.000 Mal

Gib mir den Morgen danach
Weck mich auf, wenn ich schlaf'
Mach uns groß wie ein Heer
20.000 Meilen über dem Meer
Über dem Meer
Über dem Meer

1.000 Fette Jahre stehen uns bevor
Drum zeig wozu wir fähig sind
Mach meine Tür zu einem himmlischen Tor
Durch das man goldene Gaben bringt
Es geht um mein Leben
Ich leg es in deine Hand
Komm mir entgegen
In unserem heiligen Land

Gib mir den Morgen danach
Weck' mich auf, wenn ich schlaf'
Mach uns groß wie ein Heer
20.000 Meilen über dem Meer
Über dem Meer
Über dem Meer",20.000 Meilen,Rap
"Yo, my offense is a mixture of Mike and Muhammad
Knock a nigga unconscious and talk shit
In bare-knuckle boxin', speed is the object
Weavin' and dodgin' with defensive blockin'
So in the ring, you cannot win
The top ten become nine dead if I ever decide to hop in
With the one-two, one-two shot to the chin
Knock you out like ten shots of vodka and gin

The beautiful blend of power and strength
From the top of my head, down to where my toe cuticles end
I verbally burn a nigga, lyrically hurt a nigga
Pull a voodoo verse on a nigga, Kennedy curse a nigga
Who can spit the words quicker than the average man?
Who can embarrass a man? Bite you with fangs and mangle ya hands
On candid cam, the Canibus can
The Canibus can with the stamina to damage a man

It's been a long time
(It's been a long time)
I shouldn't have left you
(I shouldn't have left you)
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all
(C'mon)
I roast y'all

(C'mon)
So come on
Hold on
(Hold on)

Yo, I spit for it
(Lie for it)
Live for it
(Die for it)
Back out the nine, commit a homicide for it
If I'm handcuffed with the right to remain silent for it
I'ma blow trial and do the federal time for it
You mad at the last album, I apologize for it
Yo, I can't call it, motherfuckin' Wyclef spoiled it
But this time for 99 I got 5 on it

You should double up and put a dime on it
Matter of fact, triple your nickle and put 14.99 on it
I'ma shine on it, watch Flex drop a bomb on it
About ten times on it, watch people call a request line for it
Cypher sounds keep pushin' rewind on it
Look out for the album with the Canibus design on it
12 o'clock in the morning you'll be standin' on line for it
I'm a live poet with a sharp ear and eye for it
'Coz I tear down mics and put a out of order sign on it

It's been a long time
(It's been a long time)
I shouldn't have left you
(I shouldn't have left you)
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all

(C'mon)
So come on
Hold on
(Hold on)

Yo, I rip shit with the ballistic characteristics
Of a hollow tip at point blank distance
I flip shit when I spit shit, Father forgive bis
I just snatched the Jesus piece off some Christians
'Coz they sounded like idiots, they went from silver to gold to platinum
After the millennium they'll probably be wearin' iridium
They so gassed, if a bitch sucked they dick they'd probably cum helium
Y'all niggaz can't be serious, I was nice before ice
Before Christ, before the words let there be light
And a light took over the night, I was born with a mic

Lord of the mic before all plant and animal life
Took this rap shit to new heights
Before the Wright brothers took flight
Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes
Before MC's picked up pens and started to write
Before promotional marketin' and posterlights?
The Canibus'll bust up mics, punch out lights
Punch out your motherfuckin' eyesight for the title bought fight
Ask Top Phife, I snatch the track for half price
The Canibus is too nice, gimme that mic

It's been a long time
(It's been a long time)
I shouldn't have left you
(I shouldn't have left you)
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all
(C'mon)
I roast y'all

Corre l'anno 2030, e mi ritrovo che di anni quasi ne ho 60, il mio pizzetto è grigio, e di capelli sono senza e Ambra è' il primo presidente donna. Uhuu ! ! Il cielo quasi non si vede più, si esce con la maschera antigas, sull'autobus see'è la business class, e per entrare in chiesa, uhuu, ci vuole il pass. Ormai si parla solo tramite Internet, e il parlamento see'ha la sede ad Hammamet, ci si spara nella metropolitana, fra Nord e Sud see'e' la dogana, pero' tutti si veste Dolce & Gabbana. E la mia mente indietro vola, veloce fila a prima del 2000, tanti anni fa, quando si era in tempo, adesso no, e oltre contro see'erano i pro... perciò... ohh...Tanta nostalgia degli anni '90, quando il mondo era l'arca e noi eravamo Noè, era difficile, ma possibile, non si sapeva dove e come, ma si sapeva ancora perche'. see'era chi aveva voglia, see'era chi stava insieme, see'era chi amava ancora nonostante il male, la musica, see'era la musica, ricordo, la musica, la musica, see'era la musica, la musica. Siamo nell'anno 2030, loro controllano televisione e radio, see'è un comitato di censura audio, valutano, decidono, quello che si, quello che no, ci danno musica innocua, dopo il collaudo, ci danno San Remo, presenta ancora Baudo, con i fiori e la scenografia spettacolare, quest'anno ha vinto Bossi che e' tornato a cantare, corre l'anno 2030, l'Italia ha venduto il Colosseo alla Francia, Venezia affonda, 2030 e un giorno si e uno si scoppia una bomba, 2030 e stiamo senza aria, ma odio ce ne abbiamo in abbondanza, prima divisero Nord e Sud, poi città e città, e, pensa, adesso ognuno e' chiuso nella propria stanza, l'intolleranza danza, non see'e' speranza, oh...Tanta nostalgia degli anni '90, quando il mondo era l'arca e noi eravamo Noe', era difficile, ma possibile, non si sapeva dove e come, ma si sapeva ancora perchè. see'era chi aveva voglia, see'era chi stava insieme, see'era chi amava ancora nonostante il male, la musica, see'era la musica, ricordo, la musica, la musica, see'era la musica, la musica.

"21 Concepts

I wrote a song about a fetus named Cletus who tried
To run for governor before he died
He lived in California but traveled worldwide
It was a big huge hit! Just kidding I lied
There's the song about the 90's, I sampled Ace of Base
But kept it off the album in the interest of taste
“Cheyenne Rock City,” a song about touring
But rhymes about Wyoming are really very boring
As for the Churchill song, give me a break!
How many songs about England could my listeners take?
There was a track about women and the drama they bring
“Hot Girls Make Guys Do Really Stupid Things”
Remember “Geeked Out”? You don't but I do,
“The geek shall inherit the Earth,” it's true!
I rapped about nerds being cooler than jocks
But if I wanted biased news,
I would have just watched Fox

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb
But when I laid them down in ProTools
They all came out wrong!

“Las Vegas Invasion” was a sci-fi track
About aliens addicted to playing blackjack
I wrote a song about a kid who made his own flick
But got a bad review in Ranger Rick
I didn't want to get lynched or punched in mouth
So I didn't do that song making fun of the South
I did a song about how girls at Stanford are whack
Called “College Is Where Girls Go to Get Fat”
There was the KRS slash Nirvana debut
But the mash-up thing was so 2002
I did an anti-Bush track, and then I did five more
But “Rock Against Bush” was so 2004
I wrote a song about China, how could I go wrong?
I rapped in Cantonese about Mao Zedong
It went um goy, neh ho ma?
Nehih sik ying mun ma?

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got CD-R of tracks I once thought would be tight
But when I played it for my girl I slept alone that night!

Write a song about a can that gets crushed a lot
Write a dental hygiene jam that says, “brush a lot”
Write a Bill O'Reilly track that says “hush” a lot
No I'm not a player I like Rush a lot!

CHORUS
I've got 21 concepts but a single ain't one
“If you're still referencing Jay Z I feel bad for you son”
So what's the secret to hip-hop, jazz, blues and rock?
Step one get out a pad and kill your writer's block… start!
I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one
If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son
I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb

They all came out wrong!",21 Concepts,Rap
"Hey, I can be the answer

And that I am that young sis, the beacon
The b*tch who wants to compete and
I could freak a 'fit, that pump with the peep and
You know what your b*tch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and

"25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
On the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied do her best but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Iverson zig zags, good night fast food
If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose

My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as f*ck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight,' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead {""No time for looking back, it's done""}

Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this

We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never

You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords

"I stay up all night, I go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
I'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score, just like the Yankees
Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spanky
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
Ya lookin' so hot inside your BMW
I got lucky, I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary is a turning and rolling like a ring-ding
Jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
I did the doo-wah diddy and bust 'em with the pre-roll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Don't rat out your boy over some rat weed
I'm out of your back door, I'm into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Not perfect grammar, always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds

Roses are red, the sky is blue
I got my barrel at 'cha neck so what the f*ck you gonna do
It's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
'Cause you know Y-A-U-C-H
I'm taking all MC's out in the place
Taking life as it comes, no fool am I
Going off, getting paid, and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box, making music for the many
Know a lot of def girls that are doing their thing
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin', like Bob Dylan
Yeah I smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit, man
I was making records when you were sucking your mother's dick

Girl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You got fancy things that goin' up your nose
You're getting fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection, getting girls' affection
If your life needs correction, don't follow my direction
You got your 8x10, your agent, your Harley
You'll be driving around Hollywood, yo, sorry Charlie
'Cause I'm running things like some mack motherfucker
You'll be slipping your slack in your face
'Cause your a false fake sucker
You slipped your slack, you cock me and you're wack
While I'm reading ""On The Road"" by my man Jack Kerouac
Poetry in motion, coconut lotion
Had to diss the girl because she got to emotional
Are you experienced little girl?
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
'Cause I'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out, y'all PCP, song out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And I'm out",3-Minute Rule,Rap

Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex

You know, I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the Payless (Shoe Source)

I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots

Well, it's time to mack
Let's handle that
In 2 to 6 hours
We'll meet back and regroup

Now let's shop!

Roll up to the crib
With some Bartles and James

Hop off the bus
With the Alizé

Now hold up, playa
What you diggity-doin here?

I should diggity-ask you the same! (Then she says)

Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together

But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-hah-hah

It's okay
When it's in a 3-way
It's not gay
When it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle
There's some leeway
The area's grey
In a 1-2-3-way

Normally, I don't get down with dudes

But tonight is a special exception (Great)

See, you're my best friend
Through thick and thin

Now it's time to make a triple connection (Lights off)

Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Hoo-Wee!)
This rule dates back (The golden rule)
To ancient Greece (Talkin' bout Caesar)
We're 2 Jack Trippers and a Chrissy

The new Three's Company!

It's okay
When it's in a 3-way
It's not gay
When it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle
There's some leeway

In a 1-2-3-way

Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick
Helicopter dick, Go!
Helicopter dick (Uh!)
Helicopter dick (Alright!)
To impress a chick
Do the Helicopter dick! (Wow)

And all of that was okay
Cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear
When you see the instant replay
""Baby, two is enough""
That's what they'll say
But we'll say ""Hell no""
1-2-3 way

International,
Show y'all young boys how to do this thing

The maturation of Jay-Z, Z
Check me out

30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still
Better broad, better automobile
Bet a yard, nah, bet a hundred mill
Then by the songs end, I probably start another trend
I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you like f*ck this is child abuse
Call diapers, I might just be gettin' nicer
Them young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new twenty, nigga
I'm so hot still

I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a f*ck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Bad boy, now I'm all grown up
I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Bad boy, 'cause I'm all grown up

False alarms (uh)
Next don? (nah)
He got (on)
To the next one (young)
I'm still here (yeah)
Still here like Mike, gotta stop playin' with these children's (yeah)
I'm a bully with the bucks
Don't let the patten leather shoes fool you, youngin'
I got the fully in the tux
That was my past, now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun army, got a slum army
To hire a gun army, get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly
Listen to R and B when we get the call he's
No longer wit' us, fire your babysitters
You lil' fucks fall back for real
30's the new twenty, nigga

My chick burnin' down Berdolph's
Comin' back with Birken Bags
Your chick is like what type of purse is that?

You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I'm afraid of the future (why?)
Y'all respect the one who got shot

"Analyze the devices
War with thee
Pieces of your destiny corrupted
Rise
Thriving

A flesh box cavity
Gradual eruption probe

Hands that caress a crooked spine
Absorbing bi-products
Prompt exchanges
That will deconstruct

The dogs shall devour and lap up their blood

Of a broken shell
Of a broken yoke

Can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up

Jump out and beat you down in some new All-stars
No stars and stripes, just bars and pipes
And niggaz just start shootin', they too hard to fight
I'm scarred for life, and charge this mic with bars of fright
Dare any one of you frauds to bite
I'm raw as life with loss of wife and causin' strife
Spittin' sharp wit like I floss with knives
Not contrived or conceited, on your radio repeated
I'm elitist and I leave this Red Hot like Kiedis
I'm a Californicator and a street narrator
Steady runnin' rappers down until they meet their maker
Concrete caretaker to these weak imitators, they a

Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.l. an red
Ja rule with hot nix I'm the best at that shit
So bitches explain this
We ride dick so well, head game from hell
I love making them yell, my name
Rule baby, and ain't shit gon' change, uh, uh",4 Seasons,Rap

And loses with two deuces and a fuckin pimple ("";A loser!"";)

Furlough inside the bait, that's what a nigga sayin

Your luck is tough, I'm makin enough to buy a kilo

Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty

I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat

Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you f*ck you my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)

You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train

"Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down everyday
Letting you down everyday
Why do I keep on running away?

Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born
See through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song
I don't deserve you, I harass you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome, you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Said: ""Don't embarrass me,"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday, you mature faster than me
I wasn't ready, so I apologize
I've seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the woman whom I
Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless
I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted it, on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should

I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive now
Meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We're supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our hearts stop
And then we end a space with a dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit?

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should

And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I live day by day, but my mind set on the future 
Drunk with vexism, handin out bad desicions 
Got shit locked like state prisons 
MC destroyer, bring it, I got somethin for ya 
When I'm red niggaz die from paranoia 
Sureshot, play yourself, get got, forget me not 
Or I'll be runnin shit in ya' spot 
Die Hard, crackin shit, like Ty Cobb 
Keep it real, plus stay black, roll with a tight mob 
Forever high, I'm the type of guy to puff chocolate thai 
Then blow the smoke all in your eye 
You're blinded, the rap style I possess, you can't find it 
That's why you want to constantly rewind it

Yo, D. Allah represent at sparkin mics like flint 
With style that you can inhale and get the nigga bent 
Cash Rules, no choice but bein top biller 
Have ya blinded by the fire like that bitch in the killer 
You know I'm iller, than the caviar, with these rhythms 
That's Acquired to break down Immune Systems 
In any battle I'm-a come in first 
With raw techniques that shock ya ear like a fuckin curse 
I like sex after Ballentine Triple X 
Understandin, I run through hoes like Barry Sanders 
Niggaz get lost in the land 
Reachin, it'll cost your hand, now ya sink in the sand 

[Shyheim] 
I'm-a live shorty, word up, the shit ain't hard to tell 
I kill verses, just like, napsilnac to sperm cells 
My lifestyle, it didn't change, I'm still the same 
Nike sneakers, Guess jeans and gold chains 
The Rugged Child be bringin drama to your system like drugs 
Live and direct, from New York like Lugz 
Is it the ruckus you want, come and get that ass lynched 
You complain to throw, I play your jake with a twelve inch 
Kid, I be just fuckin in the cut, on some Shaolin what 
Jiggy-June bust a nut 

[Junelover] 
Who dares to test me, bring it to the cypher 
Niggaz you don't really want to see the God hyper 
Active, make teachers run back for practice 
And tell they proteges, they can't f*ck with the tactics 
So give me room, when I speaks with verbal knowledge 
You put your best man, even if he went to college 
With this mutation, I serve like a chef 
What do you know, I be that nigga squeezin air from your last breath 
Got you gaspin from suffocation 
Then I leave without a clue nor an explanation 
It's the mister hip hop, be	-boy, rap addict 
Static, you don't want, cause when I brings it, it get tragic 
Faggot, now put an H on your chest and handle 
Whatever comes at ya, best believe I'ma gat ya 
Now move back from this Jack, you can't touch it 
Cause if you do, you catch a buck 50 muggin 
I'm thuggish, with enough stamina to damage ya 
crew, plus jerk em like a crooked ass manager 
Corrupt indeed, my mind is the backbone of evil 
Causin me to to hurt innocent people

It's really real, when I feel the way that I do right now
I see all my brothers underground
Pushing up daisies, man, it amazes me
That you can't see where you gonna be
A statistic, everybody's gon' call ballistic
If you had a good day, damn, I must have missed it
'Cause you mad at the Universe, going to hell with everybody else
'Cause you want your own first
I got the urge to let you in on a little secret
'Cause you keep dying if I keep it
All the killing that you're feeling is from within
For the copper check the color of your skin
Why lie? I couldn't try even if I had to
Born with the bullet-proof vest when I had you
A black woman trying to get through to the few

Wella, Mr. Black Man tell me where you're heading
The last few years I watched while you were sheading
Pounds and pounds on growth for the population
Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation
A shooting here, a stab there will it ever stop
'Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock
I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong
And try to press on
It's not white man's finger on the trigger
Car-jacks, drive-by's, callin' each other ""nigga""
I'm not here to scold but rather shape n' mold
A young black mind that won't live to grow old
'Cause you're fronting smoking on the blunt and
Down with your friends 'cause you think you're making ends, but you're not
And it's the truth of the matter

It ain't no lie, I'm sick and tired, I feel the fire
So baby can you grab my hand so I can take you higher
Coz I've seen you sinkin'. so get your mind to thinkin'
But all of that shit you did has got you shrinkin' low
The moves that you made, got your faith in the wrong direction
But some love and affection would change that
With the quick-mix, could this sickness
Is spreadin' so damn fast, a black major can't last
But what can I do, a strong black woman
Give you loving and affection keep you focused when you come in
'Cause it's real, I've got to find out how you feel
To keep your shit fixed, and your hands up on the ceil' (yeah yeah)

Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick

From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals

That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya

Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the f*ck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans

Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva

If you wanna ball like Kirk

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed

You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'

See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help

Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings

See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

Everyday, everyday I wondered how I'm gonna get through it
Took the page of the 'Book Of Life', said there was nothing through it
From chapter to chapter I was after the definition of true love
I didn't know what to do

I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

It took so long to come around and say, hello
But now it's so strong, I never wanna let it go
My heart, my pain, my strength, it isn't so emotionally
Mama said it's the way it's gon' be

But I must believe if you could sing your Kenny G
Specially if it's only the situation left to me, yeah
I must believe if you can see then you can achieve
Specially if it's only the situation left to me for the love, love, love

"Niemals wird es wieder so werden wie es war
und deshalb nehm' ich meinen Stift und markier' mir dieses Jahr
in meinem Tagebuch mit einem schwarzen Rand.
Alles begann damit, dass Take That aus den Bravo-Charts verschwand.
Einfach abgelöst von einem Dancefloor-Act.
Ich wurde damals Zeuge wie so manche Fans vor Schreck i
Ihren Piercing-Ring verschluckten und den Teddy fallen ließen
denn Howard und Jason und wie sie alle hießen
die gehörten ganz nach vorne und nicht in den Hintergrund.
Meine Schwester wählte sich für den TED die Finger wund
denn für ihre Stars hätte sie alles unternommen.
Doch damit nicht genug, es sollte noch viel dicker kommen.
Take That war ihr einziges Hobby.
Es war schon verdammt schwer für sie als sich Robbie
vom Rest der Band trennte - das war nicht ihr Glückstag
Doch dass sie sich dann ganz auflösten brach ihr das Rückgrat.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?

Es ist schon wirklich seltsam, wie die Dinge gehen.
Ich schaue mir die Welt an, kann sie manchmal
einfach nicht verstehen.
Ich weiß, das Leben ist nicht immer fair, 
Doch die Erde dreht sich weiter, als ob nichts gewesen wär'.

Wir wussten damals nicht, wir krank sie war
versuchten es mit BSB, dem Methadon für Junkies dieser Art,
kauften alle Poster, Weihnachts- und Osterausgaben
von Bravo-Girl und Mädchen, wollten bloß darauf warten
dass sie die Jungs vergaß, doch sie aß kaum einen Bissen,
wollte nichts von Backstreet Boys und Bed'n'Breakfast wissen
und so blieb das Kopfkissen in ihrem Bettchen nass
und eines Tages kam der letzte Auftritt bei Wetten dass?
Unvorstellbar, diese Massenhysterie.
Ich verstehe nicht, wieso sich die Verfassungsschützer nie
mit Take That beschäftigt haben, denn sowas
gab's nicht einmal bei Scientology oder den Zeugen Jehovas.
Und Thomas Gottschalks Spott half auch nicht
um die Fans zu beruhigen, es war einfach unglaublich:
weibliche Tränen, unbeschreibliche Szenen
und meine Schwester beschloss, das Zeitliche zu segnen.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?

Es ist schon wirklich seltsam, wie die Dinge gehen.
Ich schaue mir die Welt an, kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen.
Ich weiß, das Leben ist nicht immer fair,
doch die Erde dreht sich weiter, als ob nichts gewesen wär'.

Dann nach dem letzten Lied kam's zur Eskalation.
Es war während der Werbung, als der Rest der Nation
sich 'n neues Bier aufmachte dachte keiner daran,
daß meine Schwester grad eben aus dem Fenster sprang.
Wir fanden sie im Garten, neben dem Hibiskus.
Ein weiteres Opfer von Boygroup-Fanatismus.
Wann ist Schluß mit dieser Scheiße, 
Wie viele Teenies müssen noch ins Gras beißen!?
Der CD-Player lief noch, ich hörte es deutlich
""How deep is your love""
es waren sechs Meter neunzig.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?",6 Meter 90,Rap

That was enough to buy some shoes, pants, and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff, wearin diamonds like Puff

I do shows and rock crowds, And then I get paid

My whole click livin laid, man we all got Vets
My crib so big, I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe, Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL, standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice, so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap, so I pimp these streets

Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin be!
We makin money y'all never goin see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

Now when you see me with Tigga, On BET
Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad, drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin, like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK, you still got a be	-be	 Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

A day that I will ever regret
The hours, days, years and the minutes
The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it
The drives on the coast to nowhere
Nothing to say just sit and stare
There's nothing like the comfort of a silence
That's comfortable, not talking small, just skip the bull
Then I find myself in servility
Didn't think that was my ability
I go a yard and a mile to make you smile
But then I'm happy see I got so many ways
To make your gaze elliptical
Got a ways to go, the future's so cryptical and I'm glad
Just another many things we've had

It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see my eyes open
I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me
The day starts carefully on the sidewalk with the dog
You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry, it's 73 degrees, January easily glides
Oh, easily glides

Stranger flowers still, if you're gonna wanna
Go another day I will, like this, make it a deal, sealed
With a kiss sealed with the feel of impermanent bliss
Today my love we shall let the world slide
Turn off the ringer and just glide
For we shall never be younger again
Then what do you see

It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see my eyes open
I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me

You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry, Holiday on the radio
Billie knows that is the way to go, the way to go

A place where we both can spend our saved time
Not collecting interest
Maybe the same reason we always find ourselves

Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, brands gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now

I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it

Managers calling, I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeup's
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
And deres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta do somthin' for channel you
Channel who sorry who I'm half way through a snooze
Oh! Channel you the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my red bull and my sandwich, I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum, action
No I'd actually id rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer

This ain't on my wish list
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting see-beebies
Have you seen me?
Never again, am I drinking lambrini
Its alright Sov it's a dream just wake up?

"Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it

I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Ice in the whole damn herd
I f*ck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to f*ck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it..
Nah a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fuckin on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherfuckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the bitches treat a motherfuckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em, f*ck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So f*ck how you feel, you fuckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll f*ck you right after she fucks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man BECAUSE THEY'RE ""Bitches 2""
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me
No a bitch ain't one
(Huh, you know a bitch ain't one!)

Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my motherfuckin rent Marquis
But a bitch ain't one

Man you got yourself nothin man
F*ck them raggedy stank-ass hoes nigga

Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang 
This is KRS-One

Me knew a crack dealer by the name of peter
Had to buck him down with my 9 millimeter
He said I had his girl, I said ""now what are you? stupid?""
But he tried to play me out and KRS-One knew it
He reached for his pistol but it was just a waste
Cos my 9 millimeter was up against his face
He pulled his pistol anyway and I filled him full of lead
But just before he fell to the ground this is what I said

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang 
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang

This is KRS-One

Seven days later I was chillin' in the herb gate
But seven days too much when the gossip has to circulate
Puffin sensimilla I heard ""knock knock knock""
But the way that they knocked it did not sound like any cop
And if it were a customer they'd ask me for a nick
So suddenly I realized it had to be a trick
I dropped down to the floor and they did not waste no time
They shot right through the door so I had to go for mine
They pumped and shot again but the suckas kept on missin'
Cos I was on the floor by now, I crawled into the kitchen
Thirty seconds later, boy, they bust the door down
The money and the sensemi' was lyin all around
But just as they put their pistols down to take a cut
Me jumped out the kitchen, went ""buck! buck! buck!""
They fall down to the floor but one was still alive
So I put my 9 millimeter right between his eyes
Looked at his potnah and both of them were dead
So just before he joined his potnah this is what I said

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang 
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang 
This is KRS-One

I gathered all the money and I ran up the block
I said this is a perfect time to meet with Scott Larock
But Scott is either psychic or he has a knack for trouble
Cos Scott Larock showed up in a all-black BMW
I jumped inside the car and we screeched off in a hurry
And Scott said what is wrong? relax, tell me the story
I said you remember peter? well his posse tried to kill me
I'm all right now because the sensemi' fill me
Scott just laughed, he said I know they're all dead
And just before you pulled the trigger this is what you said

I'm from the ninth ward[Been there since the day I was born]
From the ninth ward[Got us coming up like a storm]
From the ninth ward[Niggas better sound the alarm]
Here come the ninth ward,ninth ward hard

Bitch,I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me
'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
Cause I sold rocks, upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell
Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet
And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
Cause I'm performing in shows 
Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 f*ck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride
I'm the only nigga out chere screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang
But nigga this is a warning, I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherfucking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father 
He was raised in the nine
So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas 
Never forget where the f*ck I'm from

Chorus-2x

You know you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature 
I'm addicted to making paper
Got my own way of living 
Bitch I'm from the see-T-see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free 
I take this ward shit to heart 
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind 
For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every god damn rock
For every cop that done chased me 
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn
It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball 
We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image if we were swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite with song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world",A Better Tomorrow,Rap

"I was born by the river 
In a little tent 
And gorgeous like the river 
I've been runnin' ever since 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I, I know a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will 

It's been to hard living
But I am afraid to die 
Cause I don't know what's up there 
Beyond the sky 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I, I know a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will 

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long (naw) 
But somehow 
I think I'm able to carry on 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know, I know a change is gonna come 
Ooh yes you will 

And then I go to my mother 
I said mother could you help me please? 
She said: I'd like to, I really would 
But I'm just not able 
Then I looked around 
And I was right back down 
Down on my knees 

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long 
But somehow 
I think I'm able to carry on 

It's been a long 
A long time coming 
But I know, a change gonna come 
Ooh yes it will",A Change Is Gonna Come,Rap

"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
F*ck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it

Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby, caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy, you remind me, remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys, you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true, these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby; you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And, baby, you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims, you shine

Boy, you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around, looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me, and you're my property

Looking at you, looking at another, baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist, it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips, armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip, you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine, and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

"It was all a dream
(""It was all a dream"")

Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a well as even I said
""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself""
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
""Just keep doing your thing,"" he said, say no more

Was it all a dream, tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match 
Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey be, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good

Comme si j'étais ma propre prisonnière
Ça fait bientôt un an qu'il m'a sauvé de toi

Même si il n'a pas tes mots ni ton passé
C'est vrai mais il n'a pas ton goût pour la fête,
Pour la nuit, pour les autres, pour tout ce que je hais
Il a séché toutes mes larmes, tu sais
Il a ramassé tes pots cassés
Et il a réglé tous tes impayés, tes impostures, tes ratures
Tout ce que tu m'as laissée
Il m'aime comme un fou et me connaît par cœur,
Il me dit je t'aime parfois durant des heures
Mais il ne sent pas ton odeur
Pourquoi je te respire dans ses bras

My pops came from Bed Stuy, my mom came from Africa
I'm more a nigga if you know what I mean
They hooked up in the '70's when liquor and weed was heavy
And have me and corone their dreams

By the time I was seven my mom left my pop
Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers, New York
Then my mom remarried, had my little brother Gary
My sister a year later, let me gather my thoughts

By the time I was nine I was outta my mind
My step pops didn't like me beat me outta my mind
Ten and eleven the same I never would change
He still had to hit me, aggravate a little nigga

Still wearin' Skippys
Bob had Adidas and Pumas, I could a had a pair
My mommy said wait 'til Christmas but I needed em sooner
If you heard I was broke dawg it wasn't a rumor

It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
That's right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin about

First we started off bangin up, me and golf
Then shit start addin up, we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway, coppin our own bench
Bring it home and put it in bottles, send us a rottle

Drink a old ease Grem like it wasn't tomorrow
I'm gettin kicked out of Junior High, thinkin I'm grown
God bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color dealt we was gettin it on

I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn'
Mom said I'd had to ep again, rip it I'm gone
Nigga get a little loony and grown, soup in the dome
Bump me up worst when I went to the group home

And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
My niggas I can't name, outta state (My niggas f*ck with weight)
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel

"Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say (new to say)
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me (a girl like me)
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Wanna take a chance
On something real

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams

Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest

Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams

"Les plus grandes blessures d'nos mères, c'est nos erreurs
Et le soir on s'embrouille, ouais tout part en couille
J'ai pour seule preuve mon cursus scolaire, c'était du sale
Des potes ont dû visser pendant les années au lycée
Regarde nos casiers judiciaires c'était l'époque des amis déguisés
C'était pas facile chez nous, y avait autant d'amour que de cris
En bas les shlags me faisaient stresser, on se prenait pour Al Pacino
Pendant que ton futur amour en boite se faisait frotter
Moi je traînais avec mes chiens de la casse
Mes Antillais, mes lions de l'Atlas
Ma mère voulait pas les voir, à la maison y a pas de place
Sais-tu ce que c'est que de vivre à trois dans un deux pièces
J'ai que 21 ans, je laisse parler ma chance
J'ai tiré avec un flingue sur ma jeunesse
Y'avait Jules et Mounir, pas de filles dans l'équipe
Pas de chichi, ouais tout dans les tripes
On voulait faire des thunes et puis mourir
Des plans de cambriolages finalement jamais faits
J'envie pas ma vie d'avant, mon grand ça sent la défaite (Bah ouais gros)
Little au placard, Dida au placard
9.3, Yanis, les Lilas posés dans une voiture garée
On raconte la journée, la routine
Et moi, tous les jours je fais que rapper, ça me bousille

Des couplets grattés dans ma chambre, et des faces B à l'usine
Pour percer, j'suis tout prêt, je vis de mes concerts j’hallucine
Fini les taff d'été, je suis sur scène et ça me délivre
Dites à mes parents qu'en ce moment, je suis heureux ouais ça c'est dit

Le tieks avec ve-Stee et Say, Askaan, le petit Fayssal
L'amour, les yeux revolvers, 5 ans après, j'esquive ses balles
Les 3 femmes de ma vie, tu les connais
Ma mère, Salomé et Anissa, pardonnez moi la trixe-ma
L'alcool comme solution, hardcore
Encore un pote qui tombe de la faute à pas d'bol
J'ai oublié mes résolutions, musclé grâce à mes 5 étages
À monter mes briques de lait, oublie jamais l'son
Si un jour je déprime de trop, et qu'un asile me berce

Loin des fans, des soucis,
Loin d'être mal et tout petit, ha ouais c'est grave
J'étais à Aulnay chez mes gars et je passe mon temps avec le rap
On se bousille, ma grand-mère s'inquiète grave,
Appelle sur mes deux portables
Mais je ne réponds qu'à mon statut d'irresponsable
Je m'endors dans des trains, en Ile-De-France j'ai tissé ma toile
Et pour éviter la BAC on rentrait dans des cinés par derrière
La ville comme seule adversaire, avec mes amis, mes frères
Que j'ai perdu pour la plupart au fil des anniversaires
Personne me dira ""Là, t'abuses"", j'étais un petit démon
Assez bon pour retarder ma première garde à vue
On l'a pas dit au reste de la famille, je leur ai fait la guerre
Et je m'en veux, aujourd'hui je fais des envieux
Mais je les mets à l'abri

I'm pulling heads off sharp and smack em off francs 
The best in these days I smoke on these tracks 
I'm gonna mash your plan for holding me back  
Jump up rush the office with the gat 
Letting the niggas see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep coming back and that's for a fact   
I got to be, but no road I got dropped 
And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I want to get to the top
The music go out like a fucking lot
With the key and the ? I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a ""soul assas"" trip 
Hitting stage, generate, pumping all that

You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fucking man!
You can't f*ck with me
I am everything you ever want to be

If y'all ever need help I don't wait
And I come from some shit that's put away
I hit these suckers that think they so great
Still a nigga die, so they can update
No matter how you try you'll always be fate
Breaking off chunks off of what I create
I see that liquorish all over your face 
Backstab a nigga in the mist of the chase
F*ck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stomping punk styles, aging rock got em
Only thing I don't want to say when I drop em
Loading my shells so don't try to hock em
Hitting the ? with the jig-ass beats
Bite my style, is the only way to compete
Smoke anybody if I ever ?
And anybody else that want to f*ck with me

I sing funky-ass shit that I bring
? a lot when I do my thing
Check it out y'all ain't no one nicer 
Got it going on with the mighty want to cipher
Got a women crazy when I beg
And hip-hop styles with the ss thing
Trust no one ain't nobody your friend 
Cause this business hear all about to end
Don't mean coming back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks 
Hanging out in this uniform
Keep what I'm doing here all night long
Is to keep it going, bring the thunder and pain
Ain't bitches same since I went insane
Fucking with these bitches up in this game 
To the ? on my fucking train

"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You want to live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,Rap
"What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me, would you agree?
Its almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy When I tell your love has come here and now

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender I cant explain
Well I may be dreaming but 'til I awake
Can we make the dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A Moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
I cant believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose
She wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings

Oh, oh, yeah
When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow

Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you

Stand in the back and ready, Attack
And ready for combat, I
Heavly heated, Weeded, Beat it, Need it, See it

Mad stressed, that I can't even sleep were I rest
So now I were a vest, but what if I don't catch it in the chest
Then I'm out, just like the light when the powers gone
And there's another tombstone, the childs putin flowers on
Long live the dream, of making enough cream
Were I won't have to skeem, or roll aroud with the team
And niggas I can't trust, and I mite have to bust

A comatose nap might snatch a sandy
I'm so great I amaze myself
Explains, just how vain is vanity

The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because Pleasant Valley Sunday is
A grain of salt

But ""now or never's"" a bit hard to accept
Doncha' think?

Problems of the world, lovers, girls, and things of that nature bound
To break my heart
They all show different sides of me, they're all wrapped
Up inside of me
I feel certain awe for/but those who fall to find out they're in the
Shadows in the stars
Even from a watcher's point of view.

Yo the world doesn't pay for what a person knows
And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show puzzle and stare
Singin' what it is, is what it was

'Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
Without transforming it to daily life
Is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife

All this twists and spins in a whirlwind
And spots the mask as to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane

Doncha' think?

Eternity and Judgement accompany death

Clog the fog of ""my forget""

Certain little mystery upon mankind lies
Certain arrogance, to the unexplained
Pure imagination is based on fact
Showing the confusion is made to contain

But never truly lied at all, then and now

But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie",A$AP Forever,Rap
"Check it out, yo
I be like ""yiggy yes y'all"", Doctor on call
I'll rock 'til my name in graffiti on the wall
Got flow like the rappers in Great George
Got weed? (I got blunt) My name Jamal
I pause, flick the ash from my L
I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque
I love trucks but drop-tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex, watch me
Haha, she like ""Red so cool""
Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it!

[Chorus]
Hop in my truck and roll up the window
A-yo, you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner, light up the endo
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo
Yes she with me getting low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

[Chorus]

Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aah-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

Hey!",A-Yo,Rap
"[Professor X]
Come diddy-dumb!
Welcome to this archaeological find!
At the road, witness me
Before the coming of the Sun; 
peeking at you from the Eastern side of Plutonia
Dressed in armor of Order, to meet destiny with a strong Black grip
Ten hun-zu, see you in from the Zero, take 'em to the three
Stand firm at the five; here's a star and a shield to support you
at the nine!

[Brother J]
It's like A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind, run tell your children
Fire, air, water, let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father, how funky can you get?
Now my activity is cosmi-tivity
Immortal is my soul, my God, my reality
I'm not measured by tradition, or any type of 'ligion, huh
Not even cosmic dimensions and such
But many fools, they try to post a duel
Try to post a front but they know it ain't cool, yeah
Boy, my mind goes back to things, just like the cosmic battle
When sword was my rattle
Shield was my bib, and sarcophagi my crib
Not measured by my words, but the deeds that I did for God
Illogical god, I was created and formed
Verbal shogun, yes, the cosmic storm
Who? Scrolls to lyrics to bust
I roll 'em up with the papyrus, funk sealed, in God we trust
I laid it down from circumference to dry space
And now I'm back again, quite lyrical, to kick my bass
Energized by another plane
By logical fanatics, when trying to examine my brain
They can't beat me, so they try to eat me!
They can't keep me, so they try to freak me
Positive sin, again and again, degrees in a spin
Verbs all your silly mortal g-g-grin
Make you feel you could drown in some godly waters
Take control of your body like the farmer's daughter
And as you beg for control, what's the reason? What's the reason?
Yo, I am son of the Chaos so my brothers call me Cosmic
the-hun-zu for tribal, Brother J when trying to rock it
Six-foot black boot god in the suit of the warrior
So now I'm taller 'n 'ya,check'n me out
A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind, run, tell your children
Fire, air, water, let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father, now how funky can you
Get get get get get down, the rhythm must come to such
When it's time to bust, and all the mortals lay crushed...
Dark sun will get darker
'Cause I existed in the valley of the Father
I got whooped by my mate
'Cause the fruit had a taste
Of the curse that served as a marker
Now here we go, to deal, with all the little ""-isms""
To define me in simple ""-ologies,"" Hell no!
On with the flow, here we go, sickamo'
Let us slip on back into the Blackwards row
Niggas didn't catch it anyway
They pat me on the back, talkin' 'bout ""Yeah, J""
Well yeah, right
East I flow, East I go
Cover both your eyes, and what do you know?
What do you see? How does it be?
Is it circumference, or what's up, G?
It's like that on the break, with a verbal milkshake
And a godly vainglorious break

[Professor X]
You shall be moved, logical one!
After a clear pouncing with energy from the Sun
At my beckoning - you and your landmark built
Without the Zero pride
Shall crumble, stumble my way to might
[???] pretender - your time has come!

[Brother J]
I once walked the Heavens with Gabriel
Walked through the desert with Israel
Traveled onto Mecca with Ishmael
I'm crucified, resurrected - now ask how I feel
A - D that I AM, that I AM
From Father flesh to Father Solomon
From the pinky to the thumb 'pon my hand
Bring a other Caddy and a tribal j-j-j-jam
But yet I'm judged, leather prophet and all that
Still a pimp, with a crown and a Yankee hat
And yet they ask me, ""Brother, what's the time?""
It's a African drum with some space-age rhymes, man
Yo not at all, I say it's sexual, infectual, delectable
I'm not a masturbating intellectual
And couldn't read it from a book because that bores you all
So come to Umoja, Kujichagulia
Ujima, Ujamaa, and purpose stands for ""Nia""
Kuumba, Imani, daughter named [?]Simani[?]
Came to the planet, Father [?]Afer[?] left his body
So leave the boy in the coffin within
Raise your head, let's the A to the D to the A to the M
This is the message from the Cosmic Storm
With the doubters and the judges, disbelievers be warned!

[Professor X]
With a shield of David on the grill
And the has-been proudly adorned with the color pink
Bring on your G's, your Q's, your are's and your Alphas

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

Anybody get it, we can get it in right now
Listen one thing still in the pen right now

"Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnen, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut,
So stand sie da
Um uns war es laut, und wir kamen uns nah
Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnet sind, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da
A-N-N-A

Pitschpatschnass
Floh ich unter das Vordach
Des Fachgeschäfts, vom Himmel goss ein Bach, ich schätz'
Es war halb acht, doch ich war hellwach
Als mich Anna ansah, anlachte
Ich dachte, sprich sie an, denn sie sprach mich an
Die Kleidung, ganz durchnässt, klebte an ihr fest
Die Tasche in der Hand, stand sie an der Wand
Die dunklen Augen funkelten wie 'ne Nacht in Asien
Strähnen im Gesicht nehmen ihr die Sicht
Mein Herz, das klopft, die Nase tropft, ich schäme mich
Benehme mich dämlich, bin nämlich eher schüchtern
„Mein Name ist Anna“, sagte sie sehr nüchtern
Ich fing an zu flüstern „Ich bin Max aus dem Schoss der Kolchose“
Doch so 'ne Katastrophe, das ging mächtig in die Hose
Mach mich lächerlich, doch sie lächelte „Ehrlich wahr, Mann“
Sieh' da, Anna war ein Hip-Hop-Fan

Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnen, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da
Um uns war es laut, und wir kamen uns nah
Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnet sind, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da

Plitsch Platsch fiel ein Regen wie die Sintflut
Das Vordach, die Insel, wir waren wie Strandgut
Ich fand Mut, bin selbst überrascht über das Selbstverständnis
Meines Geständnisses, Anna ich fänd' es schön, mit dir auszugehen
Könnt mich dran gewöhn' dich öfters zu sehen
Anna zog mich an sich „An sich mag ich das nicht“
Spüre ihre süßen Küsse, wie sie mein Gesicht liebkost
Was geschieht bloß, lass mich nicht los
Anna, ich lieb bloß noch dich, andere sind lieblos, du bist
Wie Vinyl für meinen DJ, die Dialektik für Hegel
Pinsel für Picasso, für Philippe Schlagzeugschlegel
Anna, wie war das bei Dada
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A

Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnen, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da
Um uns war es laut, und wir kamen uns nah
Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnet sind, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da
A-N-N-A

Sie gab mir 'nen Abschiedskuss, dann kam der Bus
Sie sagte „Max, ich muss“, die Türe schloss. „Was, ist jetzt Schluss“
Es goss, ich ging zu Fuß, bin konfus, fast gerannt
Anna nahm meinen Verstand, ich fand an Anna allerhand
Manchmal lach ich drüber, doch dann merk ich wieder, wie's mich trifft
Komik ist Tragik in Spiegelschrift
A-N-N-A von hinten wie vorne, dein Name sei gesegnet
Ich denk' an dich immer wenn es regnet

Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnen, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, so stand sie da
Um uns war es laut, und wir kamen uns nah
Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnet sind, kann mich nicht ablenken
Nass bis auf die Haut, (so stand sie da)so stand sie da

Lass mich nicht im Regen stehen
Ich will dich wiedersehen
A-N-N-A
Yeah

Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken
Wie wir uns begegnen, kann mich nicht ablenken

Um uns war es laut, und wir kamen uns nah

A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo

Hahahaaa!  I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
Like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless

Many niggas want to know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm getting phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST niggas shit!
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and

People always asking me, how your shit be selling
For making shit guaranteed to bust your fucking melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no telling, when I was striking had you swelling
Cruising in my Lands, watch the police how they be gelling
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smelling

Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss

Hey yo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writing rhymes hitting shorties everyday
In the full running drinking ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knocking out niggas from, to, touche!
Now I'm going back around the way
I'm ripping shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye

Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers

Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chicken head, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton

It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz

Sticking to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits

On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggas open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'

Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
F*ck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand

Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles

Look at all you playa hatas frownin

Fightin' for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin one-eight-seven you trippin wit Strange
I'm really real wit it, like my homie AJ say deal wit it
Pushin' and pullin' fightin' for the meal ticket
In a minute I'ma do it like a villain 
I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot 
Till the funk go pop and they'll never have other calm
Tech Nizzle, when I'm fizzle this who be you
Rollin wit Dave Trap, Violet Brown, and 3DQ, hootie hoo
For those not knowin' Missouli true

Greedy so we constantly grinding

Raisin hella havoc up in the classroom

Watchin' DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin' they jumpin'
Get back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'
Racin' to the main line 
Absolute Power is havin' Halle Berry & Juliette Lewis at the same time
O!, that's how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villain wit a kinda sociated tongue
(We're close to the end) but not done
The Tech's just begin begun beginning to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble first things first 
Talk a lot of shit and I can't take more
F*ck Jay Ferus and everybody down wit him and f*ck JCOR

And all my enemies they runnin'
Now all my hatas bummin' 'cause I was summoned
We Kansas City playas and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many point you got, I got 50
Here's a question to the Cencorship Committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
My villains are gritty 
Big Scoob, Texas, Will, Bakari, rest in piece Short Nitty
Growl wit the evil ways, power what the people say 
Rebel yellin we're felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin Germany
Throwin' up MizzIzzy so ain't no other city concernin' me
I teach it and I speak very loosely 
Stamina gunnin' got playa hatas runnin' profusely 
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me

"Here we go:
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
Twenty-five, thirty, thrirty-five, forty
Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty
Sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five ways

Today's in a maze
And start the craze
When they opened my coon
It was time to bloom

Thinkin' like ten people, trapped in one room
Sittin' in my sandbox, sand all over me
Overly anxious to get the mic in my hand
Now who want to blow it up (I do)
Now who can rip it up (I can)

I glide like the ride of a man on a snowboard
When they pick up the microphone I ask him what he flow for
Various degrees of technique that's inside of me
Never try to be something you not- and don't lie to me
Ebony and Ivory
Keys on my piano playin'
Tryin' to test some music, but the rhythm push my your hand away
Easy as the alphabet
Hard as solid rock
Pure as the driven snow
Pissin' on your block
Mark my territory then I'm right back in it when
laughin' w/ the teras of a clown when I grin

I'm manic-depresive ever since I was an adolescent
But I never panic in a sesion when I'm bussin'
Cussin' like a sailor, 
With a bottle full of Jagermeister
Ready for whatever this world has to offer me

Plus it won't get off of me
And never ever test me
I'm one w/ the universe
The energy has blessed me
Bet you wonder why you got flaws in your character
Cause you're caught in the ass-crack of America

I just want to help you all but
All I do is stare at ya
You can have a shot of this
Or maybe hit this marija
want to if you want to but
If not, stay drug-free
But, plug me in the mix boy
Right up next to plug three

Talkin' out the side of your neck it ain't a remedy
I just want the whole wide world to remember me
I don't want to have to think you're working for the enemy
Sbotage. You can't conquer this energy

You can be the center of attention if you want to
My party is in the other room and
We're just having fun too
(So I'd like to signify the monkey that's in back of you)
All I want to do is get rid of all the wack in you

Do not get offended because no I'm not attacking you
I don't have to do nothin', the rapper's start smackin' you
Maybe I should just give you a taste of reality
Welcome to my art show
Its not about a salary

Take two of these a day and burn a couple calories
Me and the mic are like Mickey and Malory
Rockin' like a be	-boy
Part of my anatomy
Hands on your groin'

Old Eddy Hayes it's time to blaze
One of L.A.'s that's born and raised

Now that we've got ourselves a little more acquainted
Ain't it about time I get this picture painted
I am what you call a psycho-analytical
Critical thinker of the formulas we all need

I think I'm running out of brain space in my hard-drive
Plus I need a memory-card for my control pack
Throw that hand up so I can see your finger-tips
I'm about to rip it up better than before

Yeah I had a crazy-people party and invited you
I didn't know my underground hip hop excited you
Now that I know this fact I'm gonna throw it right at you
I just want to give you everything you're entitled to
Down in the Leimert park, hangin' w/ the hooligans
Every now and then I've got to take'em back to school again
Maybe you should call me your hip hop counselor
I'll be on the rhythm when the beats start bouncin' up

I'll give you a minute just to get yourself together and
We can have a sing-along, all and together and
Here's  to the netherlands, sistern and brethren
be	-boy benevolence, birds of a feather and
It don't matter what you say

"Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
Where women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts
On thin strips of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction,
Eruption of passion corrupts it
Life lasting friendships involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus]
We've been friends for a long time
A very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine
But respect the thin line
Love you like you was mine
Think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine
But respect the thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of ya'll
So you respect that
And entertain an idea but get brought
Back to reality
And could you really live with that
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep it distant
Hug and kiss the friendship

An ongoing friendship
We was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked a sentence
Sometimes you're too intense
In your quest to invent
The perfect man
Please understand my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

Too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships work
But, from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone
The way we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted
Infatuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want just a touch

[Chorus]

I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turned into love
On some weak tip
See I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling
You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing
Hell, if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room

Yo, this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first
And then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of emotion

Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with
But you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship
Respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we've got an in
I'm trying to salvage a friendship

"I see dead man grins 
Seven deadly sins 
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of chins 
The all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones 
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone 
Its the call of the wild that's why my words rank high 
Drop the verse for nine planets 
That fell from the sky 
Do or die you and I get fly with rap expressions 
With the one two three four five 

In the session with the lesson 
Cause in bass and treble we trust 
With the rebels orally ready in case we bust 
And write a power chord and if the place be plush 
We kick the old school like Julio Iglesias 
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch 
We attack like a bullet till your face relax 
And think about it 
If you ain't got the class to flee 
Be mentally ready for jurass-catastrophy 

Now its time for me to rise

Down like fertilizer 
Quick to improvise

Your eyes is on the prize 
We can go line for line 
I ain't hard to find 
While we break your spine

All that talk you need to save that 
The payback is all the reason that I'm flexing 
The feds rocking like we X-Men

The crew with style that's on top of the pile

Who's up next to pull to a fast one 
Lyrically connect the dots and then I blast one 
Now who wants action satisfaction 
Lyrics remind you of bass I'm everlasting 
Casting plagues my styles crossing the switchblades 
My momma shoulda named me Grace cause I'm amazingly 
Blazing with the fire and desire 
I'm world renowned I gets down to the wire 

If any child of mine gets out a line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion 
Lifted out like vine motion I spend time stroking 
You still drink a dime potion and dime boasting 
But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality 
We be giving power that you can share with your family 
Aerodynamically cutting through danger 
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor 

[Chorus:Repeat x2] 

The moral of my oral ammunition rendition 
Tuna fish on a Marc seven collision 
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's 
And the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised 
I see through your crews like an x-ray tube 
And gamma rayed your function 
Left you with assumption 
That we be the butter clique 
We smothered with the action satisfaction that's guaranteed to be Jurassic

See I'm addicted to the paper I been gettin for years
And my whip is all white, I call it Britney Spears
They say life is like a circus when you stuck on the block
So we don't snitch and eat pork, we don't f*ck with the cops

Prayin that I stay safe and I don't get murked
But I bet I get paid, make that money work
Hittin garages, I bet I got a nigga vert

I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous

We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola, and I keep coming over

"What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?

I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
And the pain from these here, motherfuckin' verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses to the dirt, shit
First picks and use 'n autos to work with slugs to the shirt, shit
(Just to squirt shit)

A wicked hit with an expert kick and burst 'til the earth split
Leave you hurt bitch, show you how worser than worst
Get in the zone, see the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin' the curtains, bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')

I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high
Got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit

What can I say to make you see how the f*ck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
I'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)

Retaliate with lethal repercussion, I feel the reefer rushing
To go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal
To get the kickin' shit for niggaz and bitches that I kick it with

I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' head bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed

From smokin' shit that niggaz hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act like a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westside'll
Let the shit go on and ride when the trigga bust

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit
Start up buryin' some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What I've accomplished

Yungbuck's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
And starting on a journey established to stop this
Rushing up the hearts of other niggaz to get 'em charged

What's the real reason?
All you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin'
I'm comin' after you cause I'm still breathin'

And y'all can't trace me
I bury my victims in the wall like Gacey, too lyrical
And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
My music is miracle like I'm biblical

Killin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up
And speed the f*ck up getaway smokin' this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin' my veins I'm pumped up

And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggaz that's gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama)
We too much for the industrialistic f*ck
With this on the brink of fuckin' up some shit

Dismantle, deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggaz got nerves to do
(What niggaz got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you

Then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin' the verses fool, I be one of the worstest dude
(You, the who?)
I'm the worstest workin' about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose, bitch you hurtin'

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Aiyo, get nice
Shoot dice
Skip the small talk
Son, advance to BOARDWALK
Collectin properties and profit
Expand and make dough
Yo, slide past GO

[ Phantasm ]
Check the drama as the saga starts to enfold
To advance and pass GO and get the pot of gold
In the MEDITERRANEAN
Met this fly lady, and
She had two lovers
The rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS for INCOME TAX
After this heist, son, we sittin on stacks
In this new community lookin for the Treasure Chest
Took a wrong left turn, f*ck it yo, nevertheless
It's my fault, kid
We ended up on BALTIC
Off course
But still we ain't takin a loss
There he go, READING at the RAILROAD in his Porsche
Waitin for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[ U.G. ]
Can it be so simple?
Playin in my rental on ORIENTAL
AVENUE passin through CONNECTICUT
Got to get the burn mark just to VISIT Matt Life in the clink (/JAIL)
I'm bagged for stolen minks and snatchin links
[ Phantasm ]
At ST. CHARLES PLACE
Let me check Digga and Masta Ase
And the Inc.
They own ELECTRIC COMPANY
Next is the state of VIRGINIA, with Rhamadan
And got Mad Skillz like Shaqwan
At the train station
We waitin
For my PENNSYLVANIA connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim, cause he's a SAINT like JAMES
And when you're done with the body burn em in the flames

[ U.G. }
Sippin Hennessy on TENNESSEE
With Hav and P
Seen Schott Free, asked me to walk to NEW YORK
AVENUE, bag two chicks who whips were stashed at FREE PARKING
We seen Lou Diamond with Tony Starks, then
Some kid tried to buck me
On KENTUCKY
Some gang named CHANCE wore bandanas
So I ran to INDIANA
(ILLINOIS/) ILLA NOYZ and his boys
Held me down and got my back
Pass the gat, yes, I'm just cool like that

[ CHORUS ]

[ Phantasm ]
It's after three, yo
We at B&0
Amtrak and MARVIN GARDENS
A player like Phantasm is starvin
Check the fountain and see if the WATER WORKS
While I send four
Messages up to VENTNOR

[ U.G. ]
I was on ATLANTIC
With my man Quick
To snatch jewels and hit the scale
Seen 50, didn't want to GO TO JAIL
On PENNSYLVANIA
I met Lorena
She had on Guess
She said (you need a vest
goin through COMMUNITY CHEST)
Or NC, NORTH CAROLINA if you visit
You look exquisite
????? made by PACIFIC
Kicked a SHORT LINE
Shorty was mine
She was with it
I got the digits
But never got the CHANCE to hit it

[ Phantasm ]
At PARK PLACE
Hit the Parker Brothers' safe
And made a killin
And skated with about two million
But we got to pay TAX on the LUXURY
The Cella Dwellas' plan is to expand and live comfortably

Mais toi, comme un con, tu as pardonné
T'as pas donné l'coup dans la carotide (t'as pas donné l'coup dans la carotide)

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me

Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel

In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera

My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies

We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

"J’ai la peau couleur pétrole donc tu connais ma richesse
Beaucoup trop loin sont mes Comores donc tu connais ma tristesse
Même si j’ai poussé loin de la terre de mes ancêtres
Dis-toi bien que mon archipel, c’est la racine de mon être
Yes, j’suis français et fier de l’être
Mais quand je reçois ces lettres, j’ai le tsunami sur mes pommettes
Dans ma tête, des images refont surface
Le visage de mon grand-père, les mariages au village
Sache que je n’peux oublier l’odeur du poisson grillé
Quand j’allais me promener avec ma mère sur le marché
Pour me réveiller, l’appel pour aller prier
Puis sur un champ on trouvait des cannes à sucre à mâcher
Comment éviter, toute cette pauvreté que leur humilité essaye sans cesse de cacher
Je te vois encore pleurer les douleurs du passé
Pour te soigner, écoute tes enfants chanter

Tout n’est pas si facile ici, mais les gens sont cleans
J’en conclus que la vie n’est pas difficile, on s'la complique
Loin de tristesse et peur, et des visages renfrognés
J'cotoie la richesse des cœurs et les sourires de la pauvreté
Je vois des cicatrices, des plaies dans tous les domaines
J’comprends qu'mes petits caprices sont la solution à leurs problèmes
A l’abri dès mon retour, recommencent les vas-et-vients
Et la vie de tous les jours reprend ses droits en me volant les miens
J’accorde aux miens que des coups de fils les jours de fêtes
Et mes souvenirs les plus précieux sont tous punis dans un coin de ma tête
Comment t’expliquer, j'me sens là-bas comme ici
Pas de regard inférieur, je suis à l’extérieur comme à domicile
C’est ça l'époque fils, des fois la vie nous piège
Français ou Comorien, j'ai le coccyx entre deux sièges

Je suis l'résultat des sacrifices de mes parents
J’me dois de réussir pour que leurs larmes n’aient pas coulées pour rien
J'vis le rêve africain, et je me dois de l’honorer
Afrika est une reine et j'suis là pour la couronner

"After Hours it was cool

Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown late of three of course
Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whitened sandwich and again it stopped
But with the bail though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loots of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhyth's move in
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelick makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about this times
The worlds famons and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
Cause there's only a few hours left

After Hours it was cool

Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tic-tocs
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last nights game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path

I want y'all to put your hands together
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap, clap, clap your hands

After me there will be no replacement
What's that smell?
My homie smoking in my basement
Marques went up to my room with a freak
He can use the bed
Just take off my sheets
Everybody left the club
Headed out to my castle
I had to kick a dude out
For being an asshole
Cussin' at his broad
Drunk, loud, and staggerin'
'cause she was in my ear
Saying thing so flatterin'
But it didn't matter then
I was at my friend
In my driveway
Getting her number at her Benz
Now I'm walking through my royal doors
Steppin on my porcelain floor
Looking at broads
Who don't like to wear draws
Everybody got their hands up
'cause I'm a bad boy
I throw live parties like Puff Daddy
Rome, true payer for real
I don't trip when the Cristol spills
We got mo' pimp

Lets do it again y'all everybody
Clap, clap your hands
Clap, clap, clap your hands
You know I sing, but you got me really want to rap
Let me kick something

Mama mama game so sick
Call the doctor
Ring, quick, quick, quick
The DJ bumpin'
Up in da club
I got 2 freaks putting on a show in a hot tub
It's smelling like bath and body works
Liquor on my breathe
Flippin' up they dress
Showing me flesh
Rubin on my chest
When I raise a cigar
'cause bottom line
My after party don't start til tomorrow

"I know a honey named Millie, raised out in Philly
Body so illy she make a grown man silly
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly
Like, ""Why you always look at me like that, you feel me?""

There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentley's
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty

Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi
On the celly with her man, ""Love you, I'm at the movies""

Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her
(On Amsterdam, lay in the lane, dippin' despite her)

So after school, I take a dip in the pool
Which is really, on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball
And we talkin' bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money
Than a sucker, could ever spend
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz

I got a judge named Donna, I call her Your Honor
Whylin' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)

And then there's Tamika, the sergeant gets deeper
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker
Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly

What about Asia (major flavor)
Can you feel it? nothin' can save ya
Once again I got 'em catchin' the vapors

Mr. Smith bout to get this paper
Paparazzi, please give me a minute
You're pushin' me to the limit, I know that I represent it
Be easy!

Tammy, down in Miami
Fa'scheezy baby uh, I see you at the Grammy's

Everybody go, I want to rock right now
LL and Diddy, we came to get down
Yes we're internationally known
For making movies and the microphone
Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin' with us? 
You rollin' with flavor

Ask Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)
Cause after the show, there's nothin' open but Denny's (oh yeah)
Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley

Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her, anyway

You talk about careers that's hard to kill
The whole entire globe recognize the grill
Walkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!

"What I've seen, you might find it hard to believe
It left feeling like, no one had ever made me
I want something, unsurpassed in its pleasures
Because even the truest love, still can't last forever

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

When you hurt me, is it because you hurt yourself
When you look at me, why not try to see yourself
I want something that won't force my ears to listen
Because even the truest love, is still gonna have something missing

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

I'm uncomfortable, in regular clothes
I want something I can depend on
And watch it grow
And watch it grow

Enlighten to me, I never want to be here again
Set me free, I never want to feel fear again
Please Pardon me, as I never meant to hurt anyone
Let me be, stronger for everyone

I want something I've never seen through these eyes
I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
In this body of mine

I want something that doesn't come easy
I want it so bad, I know some day I'll be that
I want it, but I know I'll never feel it not in this body of mine
In this body of mine",Afterlife,Rap
"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my mind

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you
Oh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game but my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you

How can you just walk away from me, 
When all I can do is watch you leave,
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain,
And even shared the tears,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
There's just an empty space,
If you're coming back to me it's against the odds,
And that's what I've got to face.

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry,
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
So there's just an empty space,
But to wait for you is all I can do,
When that's what I've got to face.

Take a good look at me now,

I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like

Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is

I'll get you in but my niggaz want some head for free
If you're, wit it I'm wit it, if you're not get-the-f*ck ho
Thinkin a nigga get you treated like a buck ho

[Chorus]
[Verse Two: David Banner]
Let me hold somethin Banner - look you cain't hold shit
Nigga buy your own drink, stop beggin like a bitch
Get some motherfuckin nuts, be a motherfuckin man
Why'all them same niggaz laughin when I step off in that van
Bootlegger cocksuckers in my face, you a fan ho
Get up off my nuts and start your own fuckin band ho
Grab some fuckin chalm sticks, get off of a nigga dick
Even if you had a pussy bitch I wouldn't splurge trick
Man I'm comin down hard, pullin pussy niggaz cards
If you don't like it KNUCKLE UP and take it to the yard
Dead but you won't get a cent from me
But you can get a good ass kickin for free, punk bitch!

[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Lil' Boosie]
Now when I step off in the club, all the bad girls scream
Holla ""Boosie bad-ass, let me hit ya cup of lean""
Told her no way, look like you be-fo'play
I hit you with this dick and I'm gon' make you run like O.J.
Now they got redbones, blackbones, horses, and stallions
But if you got that fire cat {?} Boosie he ain't gone
You want your bread fire really you can get it
But we linin like we dope and all my niggaz want to hit it
I'm a fool in Mississippi, I'm lovin the hype
Everything I drop it they gon' cop it like I'm Tina & Ike
I got a clique of real niggaz and we ready to fight
And we fo' sho' to hittin somethin at the telly tonight
I'm at the suites with two freaks, I'm slappin 'em on they cheeks
I'm hittin 'em from the back off a David Banner beat
Now I'm skeetin on the sheets, headed to another city
Where we go and get some cat and we ain't gotta pay a penny nigga

Just tell me that you understand and feel the same

This perfect romance that I've created in my mind

I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance

"I'm like Cato, my rhyme's the Green Hornet
You know you want it, rappers get up on it
I flaunt it, throughout the metro-politan
The world's my area

Dance interior, fresh interior decorated
A painted wall with rhymes
That glow and show the biter slow reciter
Up who mighta tried to copy this style

Or change their ways, to wonder if you can
Take me out, on the microphone
I'm strong like Benzine, I kill a fiend
Rhymes in my tank, brains pumpin gasoline

Out, I use Exxon
And any rappers wack, my mind checks on
Meters and gauges, crankin up lyrical engines
Now I'm ready to roll

On you and him, your whole crew
Let's film it, now take two
Watch the movie, your brain will be the star
Thoughtless, when I take you far

To the galaxy, and leave your domepiece
In the hemisphere, now you're lost on Jupiter
Your brain revolves around, you get stupider
Tryin to think, where you're goin

On other planets, rhymes are flowin
Through the Milky Way, quicker than warp speed
Brains I feed with heatable rays
Ain't it good to you?

I'm a wise man, prophet of the bible
You wanna try me, then I'm liable
To go and flow and show, don't you know
Edgar Allan Poe, could not write like this

Mysteries, with a twist
And I insist, to uplift my metaphor
Slice dice and write, and make the brain sore
For, you and him

I kill a rapper, then begin
To wrote and smoke you're chokin then provoke
The joke the most, and walk around like notes
Programmed, you're equal to a dummy

Them want rhyme?  You do summies
Backwards, forwards, sideways
Anyway, I say hold it
Now you're in space, plus you're folded

Up, like molecules of matter
Plus you scatter, you wish you had a
Chance to shake, recuperate, recreate
The brain cells, I have ate

Scraped, soak em in solutions
Like Benzine, iodine producin
Student of Cee's, tryin to be, just like me
Ced Gee, the Ultramagnetic

A scientist, skilled with knowledge
Once a God, years of college
Accumulated, my wisdom and wit
Thoughts float, ideas are legit

To fit, the rhythm of the tempo
Also, the music more so
Have to move groove soothe and lose you
Now ain't it good to you?

Once again my rhyme blows up enemies
Wack MC's, across the nation on rotation
You get the hype at the station
Promotion, I put your brain in slow motion

Like lotion, and let it float in the ocean
Then I drown it, your brain begins to bubble
I bring trouble, hang with Barney Rubble
In Bedrock, and watch another head rock

Go through West to Washington and Ced block
The Avenue, passin you, bashin you
In your face, rhymes are crashin you
On the chrome dome, swellin your Astrodome

You're in an ambulance, I'm takin you home
To complete the ways I'm on a mission
I see your balls of clay with x-vision
I'm a scientist, your satellites are weak

They get dimmer every time I speak
On my gryoscope you hope to seek the style
That copacetically, bugs you out
On the mic, Kool Keith in a spaceship

Risin, not followin, plexin
Muscle flexin, lyrics for connection
Rhyme injection, rhythm perfection
Brain selection, has protection

My reflection, shines
Triple times your eye, invisible
I get by your brain
Now ain't it good to you?

A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't f*ck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a f*ck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the f*ck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma f*ck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a f*ck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to f*ck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

your fragile ego, ransack your evil empire like I was Genghis

Trackin your movements like The Pentagon
Disarm the meanest lookin studio prankster
Endangered, we airborne rangers with the broken language
Absorbin blows every game I strength (What?...)
The Chinese connection game of death

Controllin these mics while he aimin his Tek
Couldn't even hold it still 'cause his hands was all wet

And with a strobe light in his progress you'll never be fresh
You can't murderlise a survivalist

Don't need a Lac on Deez to make your bitch hop on my lap
and lap on these, lavishin please don't tease
To all these way-below-average MCs
You gon' stay below, don't wish, that's just how it's gon' be
My style is on levels unattainable, recyclable and reusable
but not biodegradable so don't confuse em
They last eternal, evil gas that's acid turned
When I spit it, unmatched fashion over da riddim
Unabashedly, leave sights only extreme sides of gassing
Mic mastery, necessary steps to make you genuflect
I reflect the genuine and accept
nothing less than your respect in excess
I wasn't expecting the success that I met
When I grabbed my shit and left command
Won't let it get too ahead, I got a check on that
Check you spice rack, it's certain elements you lack

I don't rap for the money but I'm lovin that it pays well
Sometimes I kick a strange tale, make your brain swell
Souls tighter than lifers sittin in the same cell
I never listen to the drama that a dame sell
I'm tryin to make that mail so I sought the game well
I know the spell from the rattle of a snake's tail
When a hard nigga spray and the enemies lampale
I'm witta female that was waitin, make her exhale
I'm Double X-L like the magazine is
And f*ck the drugs but I can show you what a rappin fiend is
Perhaps my team is NOT the type to act the meanest
but on my birth, you're just a falling Earth, you gettin smacked to Venus
Stings are jackin the penis so your label accept
'cause you ain't able to rap or able to wreck
I'm claimin respect with rappin that'll strangle your neck
Claim you're a vet but still I'm makin you jet, shakin the set

I'm unique with this on three hundred and fifty cubic inches
of horse-powered fuel injection, positive traction

Swingin like Charlie Miggetts, 
high wire torch, swallowin, spine tinglin
Break your vertebrae's with permanent turnicans
Firm burn your sternum like nerve gas and germ, warfare
Hor, d'oerve you serve, your Sequoia Heights in Stirling
Minted, quartered your terms is centric
Circumventin the industry
While your fate remains in the chains of imagery portrayed
And mass media hype, we smash media rights through mics
Crack through the core at the speed of the light

My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said ""F*ck off and die""
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as f*ck

Ever since I was a little kid
Always on that next shit
These whack copycat ball bags can suck my motherfucking dick
Sometimes it feels like coming from this planet people are so sick and twisted
I don't wanna fit in anyway, I'd rather be a misfit
F*ck a normal life, that's lame, me I'm insane in the brain
They laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at them because they're all the same

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

"So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people ""You can call me Your Majesty!""
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'

But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many player hating niggas trying to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowing
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards going
Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hitting motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
Cause even when I'm high, f*ck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and things
A five-double-oh, Benz flaunting flashy rings,
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfucking razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's getting jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggas, and low riders, in ski masks

Hey, to my nigga 'Pac,
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changing everyday, times moving fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, living life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever balling
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawling
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coasting
Where you going I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowing against the grain niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
Niggas can't stand me, all eyes on me!

I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All eyez on me)
Cause even getting high (All eyez on me)
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All eyez on me)
Cause even getting high

The feds is watching, niggaz plotting to get me
Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, f*ck the law
Bitches I f*ck with a passion, I'm living rough and raw
Catching cases at a fast rate, balling in the fast lane
Hustle til the morning, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, cause even getting high
These niggas got me tossing shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burning rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it

But they a lil' better at it than we at! 
See they plan it out man 
And and if you don't understand how the game works 
You know what? I think it's time for me to break it down to ya 
Let me tell you my story 

Now your sister lyin for you when I walk in the house 
She like, ""Oh you just walked in, she just stepped out!"" 
What I'm two seconds behind you, take detectives to find you 
Let me just, remind you, who the hell you lyin to

Dare she did, went to the club, there she is

Oh you don't think you need game, homey you better have it 
Cause women cheat like men, only they better at it 
You kiss your girl on the cheek, thinkin she sweet 
She got a man to meet at least for every day of the week 
Monday - she with Larry, he think he slicker than hair grease 
Big daddy with a Caddy and he rockin his hair piece 
He like to show off, he's spendin the bucks 
But she ain't even gotta f*ck him cause he cain't get it up 
Tuesday - she with Claude, he on some treat her like a lady shit 
Chivalrous, pull the chair out and he's always there to babysit 
So - Wednesday and Thursday - she can go out and dance 
And if she met me, she probably had a one night stand 
Friday - she back wit'chu, kissin and cuddlin 
Talkin 'bout her hard week and lookin for love again 
Now I ain't tryin to tell you that you wrong for keepin her 
All I'm tryin to say is you don't own her, you leasin her

Give you a hug, backrub, run the water for the tub 
By now, you done forgot she was a thug? 
Wait, you need some help stud

I'm goin to the health club with Sheryl

With two baby daddies, one for her and one for yo' girl

No vacation, like get you packed ain't never teaching, it's fact
I was in a state of mind of somebody who probably finna trip
I wanted a piece of a 'Peace of mind' but it got up and dipped
Minus the whip, I hope the bitch crazy she end where she deserve it
You go to work, you're my nurse, so you power minus the surgeon
With this demonstration of purge, no words I'm spazzin'
Hear the kickin' for the river and that's nothing you has been
For everything they ever done my heart colder than Aspen
While they wake up, I barely sleep overdosin' on Aspirine
Sick of people stoppin' and knockin', but still they jock when it's poppin'
The type to work for it's own, they go to poppin' and lockin'
Right off in traffic I'm hoppin', that hatred up for adoption
'Bout to be relocated, play with me it can't be no option

Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good

Never ran from the opposition
Every opportunity I get to bomb, I'mma bomb on them pussy nigga
If you count pockets niggas better watch mine
Get money, get pussy, let my watch shine
Six figures for the show nigga, get fifty for the after party
And that's for the lil' nigga
You better hold them to your hold nigga, fast money runnin' rappin' now she runnin' with a dope nigga
Two-door Rolls Royce nigga, you man making payments, I just paid it off andd go and paint it boy
Still text your old lady boy, she hit back everytime you layin' up in your Lazy Boy
Strip club, black bottle time to pour it up, peep the weakness in the game I had to sew it up
Yeah, I had to sew it up
Get money, where you from nigga? Throw it up

Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good

Me against the world that's apparent to me
Okay my momma she ain't wanna be a parent to me
So I'm standing on the corner smokin' marijuana
Tryna get the package out to Carolina
They ain't 'bout the dinosaurs in the dope game, lookin' for the doors to the room full of cocaine
All I ever dreamed, was a beamer and a girl off the cover of a magazine
Extended magazine, on the chopper and a Glock forty and a mini fourteen
Fully automatic, let the motherfucker have it
Bet they paralyze him if they missin' no bustin' cabbage
I'm from Atlanta the real one, the place where you ain't gotta start a culture, steal one
Yeah, from where you can be the man 'til you kill one
And a bird ain't shit, until you deal one
Bankroll Mafia

Me against the world but I still won't quit
Got it from the bottom so it's been a long trip
I had a lot of niggas, now I'm on my own shit
Had a few hoes but they wasn't on shit
They know I had a lot of wins, a couple L's
The money come, it never fails, they know it's all good
When the money gone, you see the real, they switching up
It never fails, but still it's all good",All Good,Rap

Uh uh 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
Get Money all over again 
'99  Double Up  uh uh 

Yo  when you look in my eyes what chu see? 
A sincere man or just a bunch of G 
Why second guess  the brotha would last 
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave' 
The booties in Arbua  boats and hoover crafts 
So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash 
Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half 
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have 
Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib 
Blick's so drunk, he think we singing ""Nights Like This"" 
He say when he grow up he want a life like this 
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this? 
While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice 
I ain't trust Don King, how i'ma trust Mike? 
I date bull daggers, and I don't trust Dykes 
Need a clearner nina, 'cause they don't bust right 
I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life 
Buy rims before the benz, so I look just right 
Girls love me, try to get the girls that love Mike 
All I need is a cup of cool-Aid, I got enough ice 

1- [Cheri Dennis] 
All I ever wanted was you for me 
'cause that nigga who I'm with don't give a f*ck about me 
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you 
'cause that girl who you with don't give a f*ck about you 

You unhappy, and I see it when you cry 
You look like your life has just been minimized 
I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side 
You just call me when you plan to slide 
And if you ever feel like you want to creep 
All you gotta do is just give me a beep 
Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep 
Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece 
We hit the block, shop a lot 
She see her man, but she don't want to drop the top 
And you know that don't really mean a thing to me 
Can't no girl ever run game with me 
You know Mase, got a lot of places to be 
Spots in Ohio, kick in NC 
And I be wit older dudes and know the rules 
So if a man pick up the phone I know the code to use 

Repeat 1 

If you cheat on me, I'ma cheat on you 
If you don't speak of me, I won't speack of you 
I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two 
Then I know what we could do 
We could just get our food and stay in 
'cause people on the block is hatin' 
They know your man, and know we datin' 
So we gotta do this just stay friends 
(OK) Amen

I lay back, I zone 
You say that it's on

Then the girl try to snatch the phone 
So I knew I was happier home

Weighing in at an even 215 pounds
Residing from the South Bronx
Maintaning 39 wins, 40 knockouts, and no losses,
It's the undisputed beatbox champion of the world!!

When I first came out, many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that, (Gargling) slow it down, you'll find that
the way I design that, and reverb behind that, not in my contract
I'm bustin all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the Two-One-Fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast'
are-double-O-T-S, no need to remind us
You're far behind us, tryin to high beam, blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
cause my persona's like pirhannas
I got you second guessin and sweatin like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

Chorus

[Rahzel]
Who's the man, Rahzel's the +Man+, so yo, pass the +Method+
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my, vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics
Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it
cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet, on-you-son, like I'm NASA
God damn, like to ?? compare on blaster ??

""And I'll destroy anyone, who dares go against me""

I got your mouth wide open, just like the Grand Canyon
I'm Trugoy, to this rap game, I got game
Call me Denzel, with the rap name, I got aim
""He's on FIRE!!"" like a coal in a hot flame
plus my Posdonuses, produces, your prognosis
Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, ""Ahhh""
Take you +Three Feet High and Risin+, like De La
see'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes and CD

For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuthin' make a man feel better than a woman

Back when I was nuthin'
You made a brother feel like he was something
Thats why I'm with you to this day boo, no frontin'
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say baby it'll be O.K.
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'm a walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin' in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that 'cha didn't have to f*ck with me
But 'cha did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
Seventeen and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know 'cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hm I wonder why
Every time I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash

I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eues when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us
Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about us 'cause we're hooked like drugs

Got to get to know you babe, baby, oh  

I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine
It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about us 'cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

That’s all I want, that’s all I want
That’s all I want, that’s all I want

From the cradle to a label
From decatur to the majors to papers, no more neighbors
I used to say I never cared about the money until I put food on my momma’s table
Follow the trail
Could’ve been in jail
The way that I live
Could have been fatal
Must have had an angel
It’s funny how I’m always on the screen
But as a teen I never had cable
But now I won it all
The world, the ladies, the whips
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed us shit
We took what we had and made it the shit
That’s transforming dusty to luxury
Being off in the cut, the cutlery
That’s the gist, that’s the summary
So if you feel how I'm feeling then f*ck with me!

All I want is money
Money, money, money
That’s all I want
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
That’s all I want, that’s all I want
That’s all I want, that’s all I want

All I want is money
Money, money, money
That’s all I want
Big face hundred
Hundred, hundred, hundred
That’s all I want, that’s all I want
That’s all I want, that’s all I want

It’s just so many woman
It’s just so many chains
It’s just so many watches
It’s just too many things, I want!

"Damn cold world
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one hut two told them hoes take a hike
Then it's on to the next one on on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes.
I wonder if I, was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend
Is killing me softly
Hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault
And the wrong time
I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausting

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Sugar now that you're gone, gone, gone

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Baby now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

'Cause they don't smile or smell like you
'Cause they don't make me laugh or even cook like you
'Cause they don't photograph nah they don't sex like you
Lets face it I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Trying to celebrate my ""Independence Day"" Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding
Still sick real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be,
you everything that these plain bitches couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you gotta a hold on me
I say I'm wrong, you say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes,
How they coming in
Just saying
Don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do your thang
And come back baby boomerang, rang

That's why
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Sugar now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You know that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back",All I Want Is You,Rap
"Waiting at the door for some kind of life 
You never step outside because the fears you fight 
Can turn the day to night 
But only in your head

Well I don't give in to that nobody but me stuff 
I know where you go when you're down 
That place where falling stars tear up the ground 
And pace around 

(All in all it's the same old thing 
Float around until you get pulled in 
Gather it up and we leave it behind 
For someone else to see)

My third eye is my rail, on this Illa-thought 
With afro-centric stamps I'm mailing thoughts 
To my Gods held in court 
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk 
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk

All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Killing late nights cruisin'
All you see is the break lights
And hair blowing you know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Poppin droppin'
The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy
Keep the ice out the club life - change face
Get on love wife while he on the license plates
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' bout cha babe
Got me dreamin' about cha baby

All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days

Everybody want to know the prices of spouse droppin'
Keep it on the low are Kelly style it's quite shockin'
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and
Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets

This Bad Boy baby
N.E., 2004
Bad Boy now

The name's DeVoe
A.K.A. Blake, oh
Make young lady's rump shake
I bake Donald Trump cake
Real estate investin'
Restin' the sands in Destin'
Yes in my..(Cubano)
Have.. (Mexicano)
Young fly.. (Milado)
Move so.. (Milady)
Up and down like she gots.. (hydrolics)
Side to side, her body's.. (hypnotic)
Noooo
You can't the one and only
I only want you to have fun with the homies
Homies, we take them up out the arena
Back and forth like Venus and Sirena
Seen her?.. (have you seen her?)
Ya know my M.O.
Are dot DiVoe, everything's a go, oh
Wait, before I lose that number
Somebody in the crew might want to talk to her

Ayo
I see you starin' in my face
You look real sexual
I like the way you move
Girl ya makin' me want to
If you like, we can change the scene
And go somewhere with me
Ya body's callin' me
You already know what I wanna do

40 rich, 40 chicks in the mix
How freaky can shorty get
Domino effect, one by one, they all go down
I'll be done by the sun... up
I got stamina
If I can't then my man can handle her
We don't hide'em, we just divide'em
You need? we got'em
Here we'll provide'em
I don't love'er, never handcuff'er
Only if she like that, then I get rough with'er
'cause I can do it anyway you like
Only catch is you can't stay the night
Wake up, fix your hair and your make-up
We make a good couple but now we gotta break-up
B.I.V.I.N. rep N.E. Bad Boy now
This sound is B.B.D.

The party's in my place
Chicks all in the pool
Ecstacy in the air
As I exit out with you
Tearin' off my shirt
Unbucklin' my belt
Tossin' bottoms up
Now I got you fallin' in love

Alcohol
Half naked women is the life that I'm livin', my
Head's spinnin', the clock strikes five
(Yo how many girls can you fit in that ride?)
I don't know, the outfits will help me decide
(Why)
Less is more, and the more the merrier
Hurry up, the next stop, the Marriot
Tear her belly out while smearin' her mascara up
Poof, then its back on the bus
She never knew we checked out 'til they're wakin' her up
Don't blame me, better blame the one raisin' her up
""Look, that's not my daughter on that cam-corder"" (nu-uh)
I'm not daddy, even though she call me that, you know me
I don't call'em back, I'll catch you at the next party we be at
(Ayo Blake, I don't think you would'a wanted that)

[Repeat twice]
You can... call me up if you want love
Whatever you wanna do
Get some friends, jump in the Benz
Tonight is all on you
Girl your body's, got me goin, crazy, outta control
Gotta see you outta them clothes
Tonight is all on you

N.E. ... livin' legends
Bad Boy now
Ya done started somethin'",All on You,Rap
"There wasn't anything I didn't love about you,
You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,
And we went together like the summer in June
But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon

Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile,
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
But you showed me different and I know better now,
I gotta get you out my system somehow

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

Put you on a pedestal, girl I held you so high
Was never too good at finding the words to describe,
Just how I felt for you but you know that I tried,
But somehow we went and changed inside

You damn near were my everything you're still on my mind,
But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin' just fine
Gotta take it back to the days before we met
And live our lives as strangers again

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

December days, my summer turned to winter
When you went away, I can't help but wonder
Was he worth my pain, you should know better, and I should've too
And I cried, and you cried and we tried to make it work,
Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,
If I could do it again, I would be a better man,
Now I'm living with just memories

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing",All or Nothing,Rap

to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again

And you know that they different than whores

But you gotta watch 'em close 'cause they blab they mouth
Never punch 'em in they face just slap they mouth
Then f*ck her til she cluck her whole basket out
Send her home wit her ass ripped out, and her back hurtin'
She want to act like she don't know why her back hurtin'
Cab fare no, hope your train pass workin'
Hope you got a metro card or a token
They all love sayin if you lickin you stickin

I tell her like this: life is good
Your pussy better, but I put on her magnum
I could go and melt her

You better watch who you approachin'

Just a forty and a roach and I'll admit you rock the units

I don't walk the street, I roll my Jeep in an instant
I rock the beat to sleep like an infant
The Likwit crew, comin' like this on you
With that four minute Olde English piss on you

You're bustin' dumb raps off the cap, oh shit
But I got the pen and pad locked down like a pit
I let the, ink submerger, into the thin wood sheets
Beats make my head bop, so I'ma rock it for the streets
I fill all my days with big butts and boom
I let my pants hand 'cause my big nuts need room
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm modern school, I'm ditchin'

When, the saints come marchin' in
I'ma roll right by 'em in the fly Lincoln
Roughneck niggas wanna box me down
'cause I got the ladies lookin' like Foxy Brown

"Verse 1:

Nigga you heartless
you ain't heartless
you don't want no part in this
you ain't got it in ya
I'm born to be a sinner
as I move through these evil New York streets
like grease
and some kids get caught up
all up in the crime rate
couldn't hold your nine straight when you was bustin
your whole clip and hittin nothing
your whole block on him, only two niggaz got him
came down fast
with the cash and the product
caught you pants down with ya clothes off

a nigga never knows...a nigga never knows

you got your ryhmes niggas?
bring em-we start that
its concrete combat-where I'm at
a crime covered city
where there's no time for pity
we comin from the village
of the unprivledged
blood soaked bills through murder actions
transactions all illegal
I smell the cheeb like a beagle
evil stalks and lurks
dominate and do worse in my dwelling
niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
(we just) bring to these fellas

[chorus 2X]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

these evil streets...

Verse 2:
Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
drivin some scuffed up ragged down beat up past tims
some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
now I'm thinking its 3 in the a.m.
I'm walking and he in a BM
drop top 3-he don't even see me
would you believe, he saw my gun in 3D
10 blocks later trying to work the cd
spotted 15 on the BQE
cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin me
and up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue
my man'll toss the pistol
and of course I hit you
let that loss be with you
the more L's the higher
streets are fire
make ice hearts in men
for worldly desire
its the black attack
born on the corner
nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
and he do anything to achieve it (better believe it)
grew up in a band of thieves
who retrieves the goods
stacking stacks
and pushing niggas shit back like they should
while we was gone
some shit undeveloped
now parlay, sit back
and watch armys swell up
yeah....punk niggaz

[chorus x4]
As we move through these evil streets...

Verse 3:

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
but when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
a nigga without a gun is like something is missing
that was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
(so listen) keep a gun, even if its not needed
better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose
nigga, we kill niggaz
for Polo and Hilfigers
its all for real ill niggaz
and steel figures
ain't nothin over here
won't be soft
shit be jumping off
on the rag
don't beat me in the head with that
go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
rip out sombodys grandmother
pulled out, the bitch ran for cover
keep niggaz guessin with our face without expressions
for niggaz stressin
I leave a lifetime impression
it shines like aggression when the flame comes out
saw the bout, what you got, when your gang runs out
shits hot, you could get burned with heat
we take turns to sleep
you better learn the street
knowledge
damn, you could get shot for 5 dollars
its live wires
with no signs of survivors...

[chorus]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us
These evil streets iz rough

cause all we got iz us

When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word
And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy
Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye
Shit I say is pretty strange
Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
F*ck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through
Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape,
A great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in
That she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome
But my style is sorta sloppy
I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
And I don't really know why, no I don't really know why

All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is

So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route
But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out
It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out
And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
She's all like, “come on Joplin, who the f*ck invited him?!
Hide all of the Heinekens!"" No, they don't know my name
My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones
Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game
I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze
And Kurt says, “How the f*ck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?”
I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka’s vertebrate (hey)
I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success
Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest

I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it

Zwäng' mich jeden Tag in 'ne Skinny-Jeans, die zu eng ist und nicht passt
Warum ich das mach'? 
Weil ich will dass ihr mich hasst
Wünsch' mir Cro als Headliner vom Splash, weil ich sicher bin
Dass ich das Herz von irgendeinem Mos Def-Fan zerbrech'
Das ist richtig und gerecht, ihr wollt Hip-Hop so wie früher
Früher gab es Hitler, früher war es schlecht
ZM, wir sind eine Grauzonen-Band

Der Himmel färbt sich rosarat wenn ich auf Tour vorbeikomm'
T-E-S-T-O ich bin ein großes Einhorn
Ihr wollt Rap so wie früher war (ist nicht euer Ernst)
Doch diese Flügel sind zum Fliegen da
Roughe Lines, tighte Skills, Mammutjagd
Bei euch hat sich noch nichts geändert
Seit dem Tag als eight Mile rauskam
Hart und real wie ein englischer Reifen (wheel)
Und auf Twitter 'rumschleimen wie eine Eichel

Warum seid ihr so angespannt?
Wir ham' doch grad' erst angefangen
ZM Gang, unsere Double Cups sind Schierlingsbecher
Denn wir bringen euch das Feuer ihr Höhlenrapper

Alles in uns brennt
In euch brennt's, in uns brennt's

Hier nicht willkommen, weil du hier keine liebe bekommst

You said it's you that makes me feel that way,

Lets take that phrase, baby mama, boo, and change it to Wife

"Ey guck' mal kei-kein Grund zur Panik
Ich bleib nicht lange
Ich hol mir nur mal eben was mir zusteht hier
Ich geh kurz paar mal Gold verstehst du
Dann bin ich auch schon wieder weg (bitch!)

Jetzt beben die Wände, denn die lebende Legende
Taucht auf aus Nebelbänken in verregnetem Gelände
Und die Show beginnt, es ist der entzückende Boss
Halber Kanadier wie Wayne Gretzki von Hüfte bis Kopf
Und ich trag' Kleidung von Armani und box dich weg
Denn du bist ein halbes Hemd wie die Kleidung von Sankt-Martin
Und deine Freunde rufen pausenlos ""aufhören!""
Doch ein Blick reicht und sie halten die Schnauze wie Maulkörbe
Es ist der geldmachende, hellwache Pimp
Und du seltsamer Spinner sitzt bei deinen Eltern und trinkst
Dort bei Kerzenlicht Kamillentee, währenddessen
Sind die elenden, nervigen Bullen mir auf den Fersen wie Achillessehnen
Ey ich tauch bedrohlich im Gelände auf
Und Hoes kriegen ne Gänsehaut als wohnten sie in Entenhausen
Sie fürchten das zücken der Maschinenpistolen
Und besorgen sich deshalb als Glücksbringer Kaninchenpfoten

Ey ich komm aus Kanada, doch die Kids sagen „alter Schwede""
Denn es ist Kollegah, der Besitzer der Alphagene
Und lass sie ruhig alle haten, ich halt dagegen
Prassel herab auf die Szene wie ein kalter Regen
Ey ich komm aus Kanada, doch die Kids sagen „alter Schwede""
Denn es ist Kollegah der Besitzer der Alphagene
Und die Hater haben's warm in ihrem Haus
Aber wagen sich kaum noch auf die Straßen hinaus

Ey, ihr macht auf Zuhälterrap, doch man sieht bei eurer
Crewmembersession nur Milchbubis wie bei Kuhmelkertreffen
Ey yo du hälst mal besser jetzt dein Plappermaul
Oder ich setz deiner Frau nen Sattel auf als wär sie ein Ackergaul
Und sehen mich deine Kumpels im Cafe
Fragen die Jungs nach E's, während sie mich mit Hundeblick anflehen
Und mit Tunnelblick ansehn
Ey diese Junkies sind auf Pilzen hängen geblieben so wie Funghipizzakäse
Es ist der Businessmann... und ihr wollt mich boxen
Aber kommt mit voll den soften, goldgelockten Hippies an
Man kann euch oft auf Flohmärkten sehn'
Wenn ihr nicht grad in Obstgärten Obst ernten geht
Renn da weg, das ist Männerrap, Bangerrap
Die Member deiner Crew versammeln sich zum Pennertreff
Ich komm an im Benz, steig aus, lauf durch den Block durch
Und schon bilden Menschen einen Auflauf wie im Kochkurs

Ey ich komm aus Kanada, doch die Kids sagen „alter Schwede""
Denn es ist Kollegah, der Besitzer der Alphagene
Und lass sie ruhig alle haten, ich halt dagegen
Prassel herab auf die Szene wie ein kalter Regen

Bitch, Obacht, ey der Halbkanadier
Kommt mit Gewaltfanatikern aus der Balkanmafia
In dein Haus und misshandelt dich Trottel wie Versuchskarnickel
Deine Mum sieht's und ist von den Socken wie Geruchspartikel
Weil ich die Ziele ständig im Fokus hab, ist
Es logisch, dass man mich stets im Bossmodus antrifft
Ganz ohne Frage und du gibst dich kampflos geschlagen
Denn ich schlender über die Beats als wären es Strandpromenaden
Großspurig wie Elefanten im Schnee
Der einzige noch Relevante im Game
Gibt Autogramme, doch regelte bis vor kurzem noch die Drogengeschäfte
Rund um die Uhr wie ne Rolexlünette
Ey, ich mach mit deim Business Schluss
Hetz den Pitbull auf dich und nach 2 Bissen ist Schluss
Es ist der Boss in der Raplandschaft
Und wenn du das noch nicht erkennst, dann hast
Du ein Brett vorm Kopf wie ein Slamdunker

"The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind
And it's Alright",Alright,Rap

Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You want to get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (its alright), It's alright (its alright)

I got a problem with f*ck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef
Flawed niggas talk shit and know they can't back it
Know they ain't real but always trying to act it

Yo if you want to go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You want to get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (its alright), It's alright (its alright)

I'm the original jacker, flawed boy attacker
Taking your life ain't nothing but a factor
Matter of fact, I'm a killer straight out the slums
No time to dump, I got these pumps for you chumps
And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks
Getting three glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
that's right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine
I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here
Putting down in the zone with my nigga Shakespeare

Yo if you want to go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You want to get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)

I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know
It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump
Don't disrespect the city, streets, that I'm standing on
Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat
It ain't nothing happy
You see, it ain't all about that rapping

Yo if you want to go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You want to get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (it's alright), It's alright (it's alright)

Straight up and down, I'm a let you f*ck nigga know
You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit
Cause you apted up on that motherfucking tough guy juice
Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music
And niggas think its a motherfucking game
Alright, play with it
Jt Money, Big Gipp, let you niggas know

Yo if you want to go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright

"J'ai commencé ma carrière en chien, sans aucun but
Reconnu derrière la vitre sans teint, sans aucun doute

J'distribue la haine

Flippe car on ne mâche pas nos mots
On met les pitts avant la charrette
Mon son ne marche pas, négro
Il court ou il s'arrête
S'tu kiffes pas tu remballes vite
Ta voix sans danger
Et moi tu sais, j'comprends pas l'beat

C-c-cause he the best I be all up in his chest,
He undress me with his eyes when I'm getting dressed

Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I f*ck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business

"Well I
Well I

I'm only comin' out to play
Nothin' more that I hate in this life
The wrong impression, I only have one to make
You can open your palm
Waiting to catch a break
The cards will fall where they may
And what about me?
I believe in fate
They wanna know where I'll be in five
But what about today?
What about tonight?

Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life

Am I wrong to assume
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh?
Am I wrong to say
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh?

I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life

Smiles around the clock
Dance around the globe to Disco 54
I stare at you in the eyes and spin you on your toes
Music ain't music without soul
Feelin' the top row
Shut the blindfolds, pass the nitro
Rock the love boat, get high or get low
Chill the Merlot, steady your fast pour
You pick up, we gon' go
Make love once more, we rest and encore
Do that-that-that
Break you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat
Never seen a one this gorgeous
Pay your whole damn mortgage
Will you look at the time?
Still you the one on the mind
Still you the top of the line
Thank God that it's Friday
Tonight let's be the life of the party
It's nothing to me
Get up and move your feet

I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine

I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine",Am I Wrong,Rap

Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up

"I'm givin' my number to any bitch
Lookin' like Ronda
I'm gonna stall, I'm takin' many pics
I'm thinkin' 'bout havin' many kids
Even some are gon' be like, ""Goddamn that's a lot of kids""
Hit 'em with a, get 'em with out of the hits
I'm thinkin' will I put 'em out of the bitch
$uicideBoy$, kill ‘em all, rest in piss
Sip on La Croix the buzz that I missed
Talkin' 'bout somethin' that I never did
I talk to myself, and all my seven chicks
They love to go down, dawg, like your relevance
I'm a rapper, but my name isn't Chance
Come to my show, people think I'm intense
Don't look at me, somethin' wrong with your lens
One day the money's gon' be for the Benz
Flow be so dirty, it needed a cleanse
I'm in my zone, I went through this shit alone
Didn't have no friends, talk to myself we always get along
I'm still learnin', I'm still fuckin' up
Correct me if I'm wrong
Talkin' business more than usual that means I'm out with Sean (88)
Never yellowin' my urinal, I'm always drinkin' on that Pellegrino
I been rockin' my own merch, I'm makin' way more green than CeeLo
I saw people from my school, they all turned out to be some weirdos
I don't need no education, Internet's my favorite teacher
Ayy, ayy

Told 'em, told 'em
Told that bitch that I don't really give a f*ck 'bout you
Told that man that he gotta quit it, it ain't cool
Makin' up for the competition that I ain't do
As a teen, all the fighting and 'em wars virtual
Now I'm gettin' old (now I'm gettin' old), and my dick is gettin' older
Keep 7 bitches on my phone like a folder
Wonder what 18, man I was a toddler
Damn, home school felt like yesterday
I worked at my mom's cafe
Met a girl like every day
It's my only social place
They thought I was from LA
No I'm not, but now I'm here
Tryna fill my parents' plate
They call me up like every day
People say I'm good, they say I get what I should
Tell me not to worry, everything will go real smooth
People think I'm Dory, I'm forgettin' 'bout my hood
Man should I be sorry for just doin' somethin' new?
Man these dudes, gotta be more quiet than they think
They be hella sure, but I always say Amen

Its like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place

If all I saw was gangsters
Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst the
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata
Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, trying to take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandannas

Assassinations
Diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby
Let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite
Through your covenant
Love to sit in on the Senate
And tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair
She read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron
Like bring me my dinner, dear
She the nigga here
Ain't we in the free world
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls

And hope you don't get clap upon

Gimme that mic, ill short it with a quick wattage

If I come off soft, then chew on this
Are you scared?

Devil without cause, and I'm back
With the Beaver hat and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's, 30-pack of hoes
No rogaine in the propane flows

Chosen one, I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter

Side car on my Glide so Joe see can ride
Full sack to share, bringin' flash and flair

Got the long hair swinging, middle finger in the air
Snake skin suits, 65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do

Give the next generation a big 'f*ck you'
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said f*ck high school, pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma, check my hits

Forty below Timbs on, getting my M's on

Still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige ""Reminisce"" on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let em live it up, split it up, switch it up
Sixes kit it up
Man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose 
On the house and auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina
I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy
They wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold rose flow
I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not domino
When it all falls down
I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future

Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree

Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same

"As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at a discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude?
You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree
I really look good in black fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitive as can be

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish Paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish Paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice

Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anutter
Think you're really righteous?
Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million time as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

Living in an Amish Paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish Paradise

"Mort est son avenir proche
Les anges de l'enfer l'escortent
Le hashtag #Vie tient peut-être d'elle
De son cou pendu à la corde
Trop jeune pour comprendre l'impact des mots
J'm'en fous de c'qu'elle veut tant que j'ai ce qu'il me faut
13 ans déjà mon premier rapport
Depuis mon cœur a fermé la porte
Aussi bizarre que cela puisse paraître
Après l'avoir ken' j'voulais qu'elle disparaisse
Elle voulait qu'on s'aime mais je n'voulais pas
J'étais l'dernier à faire le premier pas
Plus les années passent et plus lourde est la tâche
J'la trouvais pas bonne et j'voulais qu'elle le sache
Dans la méchanceté j'me sentais si bien
J'étais loin d'imaginer son quotidien
Des larmes séchées sur ses poèmes
Qu'elle m'écrivait en recherchant plaisir clitoridien
Faux-cul j'étais comme un ""Allez l'OM""
Scandé par un supporter parisien
Le jour de son suicide je n'en revenais pas
La veille elle voulait que j'la prenne dans mes bras
Mais j'suis pas doué dès qu'on s'éloigne des draps
J'suis plus dans le ""suce-moi et concentre-toi""
Dernier message elle parle au répondeur
""Allo Damso j'vais faire sonner mon heure""
J'décrochais pas j'voulais pas faire d'erreur
Qu'elle me casse les couilles c'est ce dont j'avais peur
C'était la dernière fois que j'entendais ses pleurs
Elle était morte et pourtant je lui ai dit ""A toute à l'heure""

23 ans aujourd'hui il y a 10 ans déjà
Que j'prie pour que l'amnésie s'en prenne à moi
J'assume mes actes en fumant des noix
Pt'être que son avenir me pardonnera
Le jour de l'enterrement j'm'en battait les couilles
Bizarrement c'est comme si je sentais pas les coups
En même temps j'étais pas là pour voir sa dépouille
J'rappais pendant que le prof donnait cours
Jeune délinquant très mal dressé
Menottes à plein temps, poignets blessés
Négros des champs, chiasse dans le WC
M'a dit le caissier avant d'encaisser
Énervé j'lui ai foutu une patate dans le menton
J'ai pris ce qu'il avait dit pour argent comptant
Premier braquage sans trop faire exprès
C'fils de putain n'avait pas d'espèce
J'm'enferme dans la drogue douce
Brin de whisky dans le juice
J'oublie cette vie que j'ai ôtée
Son cul plat dont j'me suis moqué
Ampoule de verre dépolie
Ressort mon teint défraîchie
J'me souviens d'cette vie que j'ai ôtée
Son 86B que j'ai peloté
J'me construis plus dans le regard des autres
J'suis ni des leurs, ni des vôtres, ni des nôtres
Cul terreux loin des beaux bâtiments
Remords hideux, sombre châtiment
C'était la dernière fois que j'sentais son pouls
Elle était morte et pourtant je lui ai dit ""I love you""

Ils nous reconnaissent au blind test
J’roule en gros caisson j’monte le son
J’traîne au tiekson sans teflon
J’arrive en moto tu prends tout sur l’flanc gauche
On reculera pas, tu peux nous sortir des noms
Nous, on connaît ni un tel ni un tel
À c’qu’il paraît qu’ils font trembler la ville
J’dis qu’un gosse avec un AK-47
C’est plus dangereux qu’le feu d’la pègre en Italie
Tainpe', j’crois qu’on est d’accord, tout l’projet a du corps
Vu l’espoir qu’j’y ai mis, vu les jeunes qu’on était
J’trouve ça bien qu’on s’en sorte
Fils de pute, tu peux gruger un temps mais pas toujours
Jamais trop tard pour ouvrir un livre
T’as fait ton disque d’or, tain-p'
Dans six mois il vaudra l’prix du cuivre
Les plus belles tain-p' dans les plus belles bres-cham
C’est la crise j’suis logé pute à deux pas des Champs
On dit qu’on va bien, tout est relatif
J’dis qu’j’suis quelqu'un d’bien, tout est relatif

C'est le temps puto, la terre attend, tourne le business
On dit qu’on va bien, tout est relatif
J’dis qu’j’suis quelqu'un d’bien, tout est relatif

Comprends-moi, j’ai compté les pertes
Je n’aurai pas tant donné
Tu sais c’est trop de souvenirs
Tellement loin qu’on oublie, oui
Je n’aurai pas tant donné
On oublie, oui

Comprends-moi, j’ai compté les pertes
Je n’aurai pas tant donné
Tu sais c’est trop de souvenirs
Tellement loin qu’on oublie, oui
Je n’aurai pas tant donné
On oublie, oui

J'étais R gros fils de pute, on court pour mourir libre
J'mattais que l'horloge, comme si j’allais mourir dans l’heure
J’vais pas leur mentir, j’suis très bien entouré
J’posais déjà sous un préau, j’voyais pas ça comme j'le vis
J’ai grandi, Papa m’a pas vu faire
Il est seul, j’y pense c’est vrai
Pour lui la vie : rien d’évident
J’crois qu’elle t’a jamais souri
Il m’faudrait des millions rien qu'pour rattraper l’temps gâché
Et qu'on m'crame dans l’centre-ville si un jour j’t’ai oublié
J’me torture l’esprit, faut qu’j’les sorte de la merde
Tant qu’j’ai la santé, fils de pute, tant qu’on a des idées
Tant qu’on est en vie, tant qu’on est en vie
Tant qu’on est en vie, tant qu’on est en vie
Tant qu’on est en vie, tant qu’on est en vie

Comprends-moi, j’ai compté les pertes

"Como cada viernes la raza está presente
Arriba, abajo, por todos lados
Armando el desmadre como mi compadre
Que no tiene tiempo para agüaitarse
Siempre que tiene humor ya sea me tomo una cerveza
Para animarse y así alterarse
Un poco de sabor, amargo el trago
Hay que olvidar todos los pinches ratos
Con un poco de desmadre y todos bien armados
Despertando al vecino y a todo el vecindario
Hasta ver que amanece y ya no haya cheve
Hasta que dejes de oír (zumbando al machete)

Andamos armados

Somos lo que somos, aunque no comprendes
Unos mexicanos que controlan el machete
Mira como sube más
Esta pinche fiesta es pa' todo el personal
La raza, sigue uniendo vecindarios
Venimos armados mirando a todos lados
Siempre que querramos, haremos a un lado
A cualquier mamila que pretenda atañarnos
Como algunos homies nado en mi mente
Zumba el machete, sale el demente
Mira como sube más
Duro para arriba que no vaya a bajar

Andamos armados

Andamos armados con el micrófono y el ritmo
(Todo este pinche ruido)
El machete controlando todo el escenario
(Con la cheve en la mano y el desmán organizado)

Ármense todos, todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos, todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos, todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos, todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras

Andamos armados con el cuerno de chivo
A ver quien se atreve a apagar el pinche ruido
El desmadre organizado no es sólo un rato
Es pa' toda la noche (tu trépale al radio)
Si a tí te parece súbele al volumen
Agárrate una cheve a ver a quien se le sube
El primer balazo es al aire pa' alegrar la fiesta
Si todo si es más fiel que se entrometa
Pa' que me detenga no va a ser sencillo
Esto está empezando sinó ya vale un grillo
Si no vas a unirte, ni pa' que te metes
Hazte a un lado, que ahí te va el machete

Andamos armados

Andamos armados con el micrófono y el ritmo
(Todo este pinche ruido)
El machete controlando todo el escenario

Ármense todos, todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras

"It's been five months since you went away
Left without a word and nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
So I ask God

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

I know I may sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You want to come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one I once adore
That they can't have my love no more
My heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you have me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,
You made me feel like I could not breathe
When all I wanted to do was feel your touch
And to give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my loving now, but you can't have it
Oh God

God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go,
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you,
When the angels call like

Yo
If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low,
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)
When they're callin you
When the angels call like (i answer)

Calling, for you, I will tell the angels now
Let them turn back in to stone
I do, love you, it's true
Fire, climbing
We ignore the angels call
They were warnings after all
It's cool, if I, pick you
When the angel's call like

Yo
If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low,
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)
When they're callin you
When the angels call like (i answer)

Uh, uh, uh
Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Auto fatigued then fatigue the enemy
Look man you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin' bastard
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
I know who killed em' filled em
With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts
Dyin' ain't the s*** but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet watch my n****s bring the riot",Angels [Remix],Rap
"Keiner jagt mir Angst ein
Ich mach' mich selbst kaputt, Digga, kann sein
Ich hab' nur Angst vor mir selbst
Ich hab' nur Angst vor mir selbst

Ich mach' mich selbst kaputt, ja, es kann sein, denn anscheinend
Ist sonst ja niemand da, der mich von Bedeutung angreift
Rede mir zwar ein, die da sind das Feindbild
Und lenke so den Fokus von mir ab für 'ne Weile
Ist 'n einziger Kreis, ich weiß einzig und allein
Ist es meine Schuld, wenn ich die dann vertreib'
Denn ich hab' mit der Zeit festgestellt
Der größte Gegner in mei'm Leben sitzt tief drin in meinem Schädel
Doch ich kann nichts dagegen und ich kann auch nichts dafür
Zerstückel' jeden kleinen Gedanken sehen im Profil
Ich sitz' tagelang nur hier und seh' meist keine Zukunft
Und rauch' dabei viel mehr als mir denn gut tut
Ich brauche keinen Zuspruch, Negativität ist meine Zuflucht
Mein ganzes Leben wirkt als sei's verflucht
Denn geschieht auch mal 'ne positive Sache
Finde ich 'nen Weg sie zu hassen
Denn darauf kann ich mich wenigstens verlassen

Keiner jagt mir Angst ein
Ich mach' mich selbst kaputt, Digga, kann sein
Ich hab' nur Angst vor mir selbst
Ich hab' nur Angst vor mir selbst

Ich hab' nur Angst vor mir selbst, vor mir selbst, vor niemand andren
Intressiert mich nicht, wie die in meiner Lage handeln
Ziehe mich zurück, so zurück, dass ich schon raus bin
Die Freunde fragen, „Wieso hört man Wochen überhaupt nichts?“
Und dann bin ich wieder draußen und mach' vor ihnen auf lustig
In der Hoffnung, es merkt niemand, wie sehr ich verpfuscht bin
Nahm über die Jahre stets von Gefühlen Abstand
Geh' nur noch rational ran, bevor mich eines abfuckt
Wiege einfach ab, was könnte es mir bringen, wenn ich was mach'
Auch wenn ich dadurch weiter emotional abflach'
Und Rapper kommen an, als wär' es relevant
Was sie sagen über mich, ist doch komplett egal
Die sind alle gar nicht da, die sind alle nicht real
Nur paar Typen mit kaputten Egos, damit komm' ich klar
Doch was nicht geht, ist dis Leben leben, wie ich's leb'
Habe Angst, aber nur wenn's um mich geht

"Gentlemen and ladies, it's your boy, the dude
Freaky, fre-fre-fresh

Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal

How you just gon' back me up and I'm 2 dollars from bein' rich
You oughta be grateful a nigga like me even see you bitch
I was thinkin' about rockin' Arribas, but the gators look nice
Nigga was talkin' about they was comin' out like players tonight

They won't let me in with my pistol, I'm okay with the knife-a
Anything I can get my hands on when the fight starts
Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could [Incomprehensible] light stars

She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids
For instance, I can come through bouncin' in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up

Wonderin' how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus
You're wild hoe be fuckin' up my G's
You better get back, I spent six and a quarter for these, ya hear me?

Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal

Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it

I see you watchin' how the boy comes to Grover
And you wanna overthrown him, knock him off his throne
Your potnahs rockin' with you 'til they find out who it is
Then they gon' try to convince y'all to leave it alone

I'm here to sabotage what enemies accomplish
They're not about the camouflage, the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody, I just make sure I pay homage

Hey shorty, this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back
They like it when a gangster take control like that

She feels protected when she in that Lexus
Givin me head, got me takin' all wrong exits
I'm not the people you should be upset with
I don't mean no harm baby and I'm not sexist

Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal

Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it

A gangsta still fightin' charges but he totes that glock
Like a junkie with a pipe up in the smoke crack spot
I be in every hood, see I knows the block
From Watts to one-fo'-fifth by the clothing shops

Nope, I ain't rockin' with them boys I was with
But I'm still blingin' and showin' off my toys in this bitch
When a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names

Claimin', she ain't nuttin' like them boys be sayin'
Shit I'm only tryin' to knock the pussy outta the frame
Look here, I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it, 'bout to get another deal

I got my hand wrapped around the steerin' wheel
Hoes like eww, they can't understand the grill
Skip called me up he got them all on chill
Well, let's go and get us some hoes so we can do this heah, why'know

Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
Woof, I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes, I am a animal

Welcome to ""Animal House"" 
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'ma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a ""Hello"" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I want to make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album number three and 
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently number one at 3 with videos on MTV 
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Chorus]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep 
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire 'cause what I propose is a resonation 
'cause the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles 
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds 
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and ""ang"" espacio

[Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Look I'ma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit 
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant 'cause bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearsals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin

[Chorus] - repeat 2X",Animal House,Rap
"[GZA]
Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch 
The rat squeals 
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals 
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles 
Where the leopards grab the wilder-beast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees 
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves 
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk 
Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk 
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain 
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra 
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah 
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet 
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see 
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators 
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later 
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees 
The tick moved with the fleas 
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas 
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow 
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough 
See a million mosquito's from the West now 
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild 

[Chorus: x4]
It's like the jungle sometimes 

[GZA]
Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger 
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper 
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation 
Mosts of their prayers die from broke bones and suffocation 
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark 
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark 
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved 
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist 
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist 
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale 
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail 
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes 
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes 
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor 
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula 
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies 
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies 
What costs little, is a little worth 
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf 
From birth they grow up walking the thin line 
It's like the jungle sometimes 

[Chorus: x4]",Animal Planet,Rap
"Annie no, no, no, I gotta go, go, go

To cure my sickness for some girl
Pain and pills all in my cup
We make love and then we uhh
I got keys inside my whip
Pasta pasta she's my bitch
Me write song and then we dip
All these hoes they played my chips
Jesus called he said what's up?
(Oh there Annie) What the f*ck?
Rainbow dog and smokey flames
All y'all black with whitest names
Tread my head my neck it ache
(Oh there Annie) Cast that fame
(Love you granny) We done came
(In Miami) Surfin' my wave
Man I love music cracking my mucus
Flowing like Cuba kill me I'm human
Teacher turned student, f*ck am I doing
F*ck is my momma Annie I'm choosing
She done raised Alex he was that savage
She was that monster raised up in malice
All in my habit split my wing backwards
Disappear magic abracadabra
I coulda been a felon on broadway
He say she say all in the wrong way
(Oh there Annie) Still playing doomsday
(Oh there granny) Trapping out the hallway

Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone, no I can't leave you alone
Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no, I can't leave you alone

Magic in my hands all day and all night
Running through stop signs, running through life
Might kill me a nigga might f*ck tonight
A (?) of weed is all I need
The (?) skeet skeet skeet
The picket fence, the corner shop
The after school, the girls we got
Way way back in the nosebleed section
I'm so young so dumb so reckless
I got bars like antidepressant
He xanned off but your girl stay texting
All this damn gold on my neck, I'm flexing
Two chains, two names y'all keep guessing
High five and a hip hip hooray
Got boys scout word all this shit that I say

Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me
Now we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley of this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch in you, yeah I know what's beef

Sorry, Mr. Williams moved out the building

(Slow down, son, you're killin' 'em) Well funded it was not gangsta
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove through his city
Now, all the little bitties, from ugly to pretty
I was the magician, mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a blow-pop baby
And it get stiffer than some Botox baby
But show out baby, and show me you gon' act right
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She don't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it
What?

Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac

I style crazy and net like Jay Z

Spittin my verbal attack with the impeccable speech
How bout niggas, gotta keep your dog on a short leesh
Got 'head speak, If not they try to play us like suckas
The most commitment, wanted non commitment givin mothafuckas
Not sayin that all men fall in this category
But one look in his eyes and I can tell they whole story
Lookin for a friend or wife for late nate creep if he's horny
If he's sincere, got G, or pick up lines that corny
Tryin to say that he adore me, when he don't even know me
That type of weak game will leave a nigga, poor broke & lonely

Perfect example, it was like Monday the 10th
Late afternoon, just on my king and it was time well spent
In any event, this niggas eyein me, it's evident
Try hard to cement, to ignore his twisted compliments
He seem hell bent for my time, a hundred percent
Asked to come to sit at my table, if I was the age of contended
And no why he would put himself through such torment
And despite the corny line, you could see the extent
That he would go, said he'd pay my rent, dress me and give me dough
Follow by cants and comments bout my bodies measurements
I said ""I don't drink moet, take loot to get bent
Or use niggas to pay rent, I'm independent""
His response that ""You heaven sent
But I haven't met a chick that ain't have a price yet""
I said ""Well, I must be a different type of female
While bitches waitin to exhale, I plot schemes to black male
Talkin bout, you wash your car, who you knew and your wealth""
A new expirement, thinkin this niggas playin himself
With just his arogance, not to exclude his rude attitude
How he pursued, relentless references to seein me nude
The wrong move, this jiggy nigga really thinks he's smooth
Like he got somethin to prove, and I got nothin to lose
I know his style, never ran into a femme fatale
Like you hearin right now, comin through ya ear canal
I smile politely, so as not to blow my cover
Carryin on conversation, knowin that I'm on some other shit
Should have stopped when he had the chance to quit
Talkin about his income, and how bout he want to get some
Next time we meet, he'll just be the next victim

Like my girl Nina, bangin body and she was cute
But she'd only f*ck with niggas if they had mad loot
Plenty ice, nice ride, but she'd always have to drive

She survived, only to end up to being 85

"(Cold 187um)
 
See it was seven o'clock
and the sun had just set
the crew rolled up and said it time to jet
I was kinda hesitatin' cause it was nothing to do
but we always find something to get into
Total-Kaos broke out he said lets go to the movies
he was paying so I wasn't being choosy
jumped in the ride and proceeded to go
""yo what are we goin' to see?""
""yo man I don't know""
but when we got there it was a quarter to nine
to see the main flick it was a long as line
paid to get in and not a second before 
a sucka looked me up and down at the front door 
now I shined on and walked on in 
but he kept on staring again and again
I walked up and said ""what's up""
he said: ""not you""
I turned around and then I looked at my crew
because I know he didn't say what I thought he said
and if he did 
I'm gonna have his head on a platter
the sucka scared out
when we got ill
the brother who tried to front he got his caps pilled
and his homies they got mad 
but they soon broke out
because of what we had

chorus:
because I take out my weapon 
and I quickly start blastin'
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse they say nothings confusin'
why? why? why?
it's just another execution

See it was early 
we was bored uptight
so we rushed up to In-and-Out
to get a bite to eat
I saw a freak I hadn't seen in a while
the one with the crazy eyes and the pretty smile
she was def you know what I mean
the hoe was stacked to the max 
in a skin-tight jean
she sat across the room 
and try to stare at me
then send a note about how she wants to get with me
now I'm wonderin' what has changed
is it that I'm rockin' the house
and that I'm makin' a name for myself
cause when I first met her
all she said I did with her was upset her
I think that sneak she's tryin' to play me down
cause I ain't the one that likes to be clowned
so I told the hoe to leave me alone
I said girl you need to take your stuck up ass home
at this second her boy walked in
I said man do I have to act crazy again
then I grabbed my weapon it's time to get ill
you can say it is cool or you can straight get pilled
with buck shots I mean all over the place
in your back, your side
in your stomach, in your face
cause I don't really care what your girlfriend says
if you keep talkin' shit you get a bullet in your head
so anyway what your beefin' about
if I wanted your hoe she'd  be already turned out
she's jockin me 
she might go with you
now checkin' your girl is what you need to do

With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, 
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along,
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat

"Early in the mornin' 'round 3 a.m.
Lyin' with a girl named Kim
With a glass of gin, sippin' on it
'Bout to hit the skins, now I'm all in
Telephone ring, was a girl named Jane
From around the way
How could I forget, down in my car
""Is it time to quit,"" runnin' through my head
I ain't tryin' to run around no more
Sick and tired of losin' track of score
Every time I turn around
The same old game another day
Thinkin' I just want to settle down
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now
Said to myself
""There's got to be another way""
Later in the day, next day
This was a girl named Trace
Drinkin' ???, spreadin' her legs
Drinkin' ???, callin' my name
Telephone rings she said that
It was a friend on the other end
Sound masculine, couldn't believe
How could I pretend, didn't hurt me
Finally I can see
There's another life for me
I don't want to live this way
I feel it's time I made a change
I believe I can be (Ho...ho...ho...)
A better man and I don't need

If you're not flipping cuts like DJ Romes
Well then you're not representing with the LP
If you're not dropping tracks like Madlib
Well then you're not representing with the LP
Well if you're not kicking styles like Wild Child
When then you're not representing with the LP
But if you're not supporting hardcore hip hop
Well then you're not a real hip hop MC

[Wild Child]
If you're not in tune to this total bliss
Now a days a lot of rappers I like to diss
'cause yo, all up in your songs you be talkin' bout your glocks (what?)
But then you change 'cause you can't be the same around the clock
You be actin' like a Amazon when the camera's on
But when the camera's off, you be actin' soft
'cause you be in that mental state, thinking that ya great
But everywhere around the gates people saying that ya fake
Like dropping out of weight while you're trying to have your cake
But ya jams ain't got no weight and many niggas won't debate
(Hey, how we do?) we keep it hot like Benihana (word)
With no drama, while you try to bite like a piranha
I'll make you wanna...

[Madlib]
...bounce, bounce when you come to see the Pack
I'mma carbonate ya flow 'cause yo' style be sounding flat
Jack A.K.A. constructor of a rhyme on a track
Conducted by Madlib invade ya face like blah
Bring it back as I rock it slow, with my lip socket lyrics,
scratch as I rock a show with simultaneous functions we create
'cause we're the sure shot
The flow got you all hypnotized but if you're not...

Yo, Wild Child straight rearranging on ya drums
Ya niggas from the slums step up ya want to hum
As I take ya ass way back when blacks was like chilling
(To late for that now) Why? (Brothers mad killing)
Yo, I live in hip hop day to day because I feel it
Can't understand wack MC's out there, they try and kill it
I'll steal it, take it home, package it and seal it
Bring it out on a daily basis and fry it on a skillet
Question: Will it, will it last forever?
Can't compare it to the past...never!
We're used to touch the mics, uplifting MC's on the rise
Come with the abstract and then straight up vocalize

[Madlib]
Most people now a days talk about representing
They strictly smoking Philly's, acting ill, getting bent and
The ways of the industry's mad shady tinted (yeah)
Most niggas tripping off the ill joints we invented (right)

Alaska, Nebraska, Japan you have ta
Know the difference from a fake MC to a real MC

As you witness anuthatantrum, fantastic, mantic, keeping niggas frantic.

Fishing for my next victim with no permission.

"Uh-huh, uh-huh, motherfucker, uh-huh
Yeah, I see that, I see that
All y'all fake motherfuckers up in the joint, huh?
Stealing my light, huh? Watch me, duke, watch me

Yo, check these up top murderous
Snowy in the bezzle as the cloud merges
F.B.I. try and want word with this
Kid who punked out bust a shot up in the beacon
Catch me in the corner not speaking
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli, Wally's look stinky
With his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his tiny form
Everybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw a hand in your bag
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassing niggas, my impostors scream they ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhyming at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to Enter
Punk fagot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma,
beneath the La-Z-Boy where ya hid ya knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillac's, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Darthy tried to judge these
plush degrees, said the cow, wrap the fees
Getting waxed all through the drive-through
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
and tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite
student in role holding it

Hey yo, this rappin's like Ziti, facin me real TV
Crash at high-speeds, strawberry, kiwi
As we approach, yo herb, the Gods bail
These Staten Island ferryboat cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 thief up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real

A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, stack 'em up Son, $20 off no tax
Street merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas verse Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two culture-ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't looking, splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up
Mossied off gracefully, New York's most wanted tee-ball hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, lust of pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last scene, Manhattan Chase
We drew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound

We split a fair one, poker nose money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, you taste a tea-spoon, 300 goons, stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stock's full, hustle invasion
Knowing now, we cocked a block off, the chain tri-color
Freezing in valor, ice-sicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams
pose at the stand-off, mad timid
hoping that the gun fall, guess him like lottery balls, yo

"I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the ""Drop!""
Cause her son caught the slug.
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack and fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna f*ck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've f*ck with it
Appetite for destruction,
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit,
Murder in the first degree, a man slaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayings for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

You guys know who I'm talkin' to

That Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Try for some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm the kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang!
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb
I do damage with a 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas yo
And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so
But any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's a million and one
That couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up da essence appetite for destruction

""They put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they realy degrade you,
White folks don't believe that shit, don't believe that cops degrade you,
Oh come on, those people, those people was resistin' arrest""

Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin',
I possess the 10 commandments of the Hip Hop Thugster,
Known as a thief and murderer
First one,
Alibi a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one,
Always gotta f*ck outta wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap crackle and pop
Number three,
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryin' to cause some static
Number four,
Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one,
My killings just begun
I pulled out my gun, now they keep me on the run
Step six,
It's kinda tricky,
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E,
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight,
Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch yo' pray
Ninth one,
I gotta be raw, f*ck any brain-washing man made law
Last but not least, I must be real,
Number ten, is my appetite to kill",Appetite for Destruction,Rap

Incense was burnin' so I'm feelin'  right, aight

I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got

Told him that ghetto is the aim, let go of my brain

Jazz, in the last 5 years has progressed in its fits
And starts of sudden discoveries and
Startled reactions. New principles, new sounds
New rhythms and harmonies have been advanced with unusual frequency
Not surprisingly, many of the younger musicians have been quietly digesting
This information almost as quiuckly as it has appeared
As a result, they've acquired a degree of
Musical sophistication which supersedes many of the previous standards of excellence
So it's no longer especially relevant to ask the young saxophone player
For example, to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks

Come little hoods peep out the eyelids
Stash a fat gat cause the loops let you dig

From the chaos came the fattest little shit
By the soak of it at the point of hammer click

Pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena
Alegrias pero tambien tristezas
Amor pero tambien odio why este que te habla ha caminado por sombras
De valle de muerte conociendo las dos caras de la vida

why sembrarlos en tu consiencia
A pasado el tiempo why an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes why nuevas modas

Dia a dia canto mi presar why represento
Dia a dia tengo a todo el mundo mas adentro
Dia a dia tratan de quedarse con mi asiento
Pero dia a dia se que sigo siendo el mas violento

Abre los ojos why averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo
Todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran
Regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan, OK!!

Yo lyrical traqui trac, no traten de engañar al mundo
why diciendo mil palabras por segundo
Porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer
Algo especial pero terminan igual
Repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones
Se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones
Buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo
El fracaso esta automatico, maniatico rebelde why mas clemente de inocentes
Si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente
Porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica
Pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica
Ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto
Pues regresa con el muy largo YO!

Call me a player cause I crush a lot

Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant f*ck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And f*ck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign

But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone

"Sei la visione che mi circonda come l'aria che respiro e non see'è spot sul mio foglio bianco resta la mia biro rinchiusa in una gabbia di paura non vuole che le mie parole inquinino quest'aria pura, sono in preda a questa antica magia, strana alchimia, nuova mania di cercare dentro il tuo ricordo qualche profezia, in balia di una marea, la verità sotto un vento di bugie, e tu sorridi in mezzo a tutto questo, tu che sei l'aria fredda la mattina presto mentre mi vesto, riempimi la bocca con il primo sbadiglio sei il sogno che comincia nel momento in cui mi sveglio, lasciati respirare aria d'altitudine quella che dà origine a vertigine ed inquietudine e mentre osservo il vento muovere le nuvole dipingo in cielo la tua immagine e scopro che per me sei aria. 
Ed adesso barman riempimi il bicchiere metti qualcosa di tranquillo poi vieni qui a parlare, tanto già lo so che hai già capito che mi è capitato, il tuo bancone ne ha sorrette di persone messe in questo stato, parlami degli amori che hai passato io ti parlerò del mio che è appena nato. Ti parlerò di lei, dirò cose che fra un'ora non ripeterei, che a lei non direi mai. Ok, ora metti che ha queste frecce veramente questo Cupido che le tira, ecco ha sbagliato mira, ha colpito me e lei no, lei questa notte dorme con qualcuno che non so e io non dormirò, succede o almeno dicono, in un film lo troverebbero poetico romantico una cotta a senso unico, io mi vedo comico e rido di emozioni senza traettoria guardando lei dispedersi nell'aria. 
Ora veniamo a noi signora che mi giri in testa, che ieri sera sei uscita col mio cuore in tasca labbra rosse di rubino il mio ricordo mentre bevo vino il mio compagno di San Valentino. Sei la regina di un ignaro re fra gli uomini, mia privata fantasia lascia che ti esamini, occuperei la lingua mia in approfondite indagini, impartirei il tuo corpo che nemmeno immagini, ma l'aria è di tutti e di nessuno, possa respirarla e sporcarla con del fumo e ti respiro anche quando tiro dalla mia Marlboro soffiando gioco a fare anelli con i tuoi capelli d'oro, dura messo male da paura barman dammi tu la cura stasera sono fuori gara, brindiamo alla memoria di una storia senza gloria una febbre d'amore necessaria come aria",Aria,Rap

Us together, nothing better, you’re all I have to lose
So if this is our final hour,
I’ll show you without a doubt how strong, how deep my love can go

So tonight I’m gonna love you like it’s the last on the earth

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't f*ck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend

Around my way
Around my way
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way

These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way

What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school

"Come to me, in all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Give it time, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose, can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Come to me, with all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lover's kites, are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose, can profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Brushes with darknes won't help you create
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything
I try to sell myself but I am really laughing
Because I just want the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on 
You sweat as you step about to get hype 
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic 

You're physically in this with me but how could you tell 
If it's meant to be hip hop if you're not mentally as well 
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured 
Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored 

If you just keep kickin' listen, to the mix 
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand 
Holds and controls you 'til I leave 
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe 

The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then 
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhymes' the oxygen 
Then wave your hands, when you're ready I'll send you 
Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue 

And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously 
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be 
Rising to the top, and I came to drop it 
Catch it and quiz it, is my topic 

Universual 'cause I move everybody to come 
By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one 
You look around and see how packed the party starts to get 
I draw a crowd, like an architect 

The five borroughs react and all the islands attract 
And every state can't wait, so they attack 
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed 
It'll be more room if MC's play the back 

I'm the are the A to the K-I-M 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am 
The microphone fiend if I was a fake 
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make 

I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite 
Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like 
The voice on the record, I see what you mean 
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream 

So just, give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it 
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it 
Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well 
Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells 

I took time to write, tonight I will recite 
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight 
Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin 
MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin 

Home to tell a friend when the party ends 
""Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again"" 
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage, 
Tape by tape and page by page, 

When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix 
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets 
Deeper and Deeper, I hope you understand it 
I made it up myself and I planned it 

For other MC's who waste time 
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme 
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating 
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking 

They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' 
To get up on the microphone and then start takin' 
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it 
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet 

Attracted to a freestyle put in effect 
You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet 
So Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight) 
Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, 

I want you to hear this perfectly clear 
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? 
I hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished this song 
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...",As the Rhyme Goes On,Rap

Got the mind and the muscle
50 carrots in the crown just to shine on you suckers
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the busters
F*ck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him
Don't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips
Haters want to stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of that
Five karat stones with the platinum all up under that
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of that
I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of that

Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on White street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

Flip, say who known to the land and the people
My plan is to keep you at least two, levels under me where I need you
I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white tees and the v-suits
O.G. status, don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outa line and you runnin' outa time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time
Yeah I know you were thinkin' out of sight and outa mind
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine
Listen nigga this shit here is more than just alota rhymes

I told you I wouldn't be long,

Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Follwin' fundamentals, I'm followin' in a rental

And this room feels so cold
No one to care and no one to hold
Yeah the lord knows
That I'm needing somebody like you, just like you
Can you see
The passion burning in my eyes

The rush you give my heart
And if you knew
The secret way I feel for you
Would you come running
To me or would you turn away

With hope and faith

I pray together we will be
And there will come a time
You'll be mine, all mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes at night I'll pray

Should I feel
These emotions deep inside me
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul
I'm so afraid
But it's something that you've got to know
How I want
To touch you every time you're near
I long to feel
Your body next to mine
And if you knew
The secret love I have for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away

If all my prayers were answered
Our hearts would be enraptured
We would find our heaven
Inside each other's arms

I went to the party
Ya know what I mean?
I want to the party
Just me, a lonely MC
You can pop the cork,
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!

I went to the party, but I couldn't get in
I asked the bouncer if he knew my girl Hesta Prynn
He said, ""I know that girl, are you in that band?""
I said, ""I think I'm on the list, could you stamp my hand?""

He said, ""Step inside girl, you look alright
Hold up - do you satisfy the minimum height?
You gotta be this tall to ride tonight""
I said, ""I might be short, but I can still party
I can shake it on the floor like Melissa Alardi!""

I went to the party, but I'll never go back, yo
The speakers were shitty and the jams were whack
This girl at the bar said, ""Northern who?""
I said, ""It's Northern State, haven't you heard of my crew?

Yo we rock the stage anyway we want,
Hell I'll rock this party like a debutante
Riverdale's too Kiwanis
True party people want us, yo
Keep it real, I gotta break the seal

Close my eyes as I leave the house (close my eyes and i)
And then I'm at the party and I'm fillin out (im at the party and i)
And then I'm watchin my worries as they floatin by (watch all my worries just)
It's just, there they go, slippin away now (slip away)

It's alright if you're feelin bad (it's alright ??)
And then you're at the party and you feel so glad (im at the party and i)
And you wanna know if it's time to work or play (just don't know if)
It's just - should I go or should I stay now? (i should go or stay)

All the way from Avenue D
Lookin for Katie Cassidy
I noticed this guy was starin at me

He said, ""Hi,"" I said, ""Hi, do I know you?""
He said, ""Yeah, don't you run in that girl rap group?""
Uh huh ho, you're the one with that liberal arts
Academic, literary kinda name, right?

I said, ""Like Gorgeous George, my name is Hideous Hesta
Rhyme with pizazz, and I am the masta
Shout out to Cynthia plasta casta
Speed up the tempo and I'll go faster!""

Uhn! You wanna know what it's about?
I like to party but I never go out
Mailin' and I'm maxin', callin' and I'm faxin'
I need some more relaxin', 'cause my job is real taxin'!

"We laughing at ya, talkin' bout ya, no one else on that one
We know you be hustlin' backwards, Electric Slide on rewind
My pockets is looking like rerun
I've begun to dethrone, you sippin' on that Seagram's
Talkin' bout you gone kill somethin'
Niggas must think they real or somethin'
Go on ahead and pop a pill or somethin'

Got the game on lock like we changed the keys
No you can't get in, but your whore out, treat that mouth like police raid a house
Bust all up in it, nuts up in it
Brand new tenant, moved all up in it
That's no lease, this ain't rented
Came back now, it's OG-scented
Who the f*ck you think ya'll is
I'm a grown ass man, I don't play with no kids
Back in 2003 used to post up and roll up bag of pounds of the meat
Used to trap OG with the E, on the Greyhound bus one pair of jeans
Touchdown in the city
Like ""Nigga where the fiends?""
Now I do the same thing
But it's with 16s
Get money my nigga like a poster, If I don’t then I might go postal
Back a nigga down like Howard tryna post you
If you play around with a nigga, might smoke you
Beware what you say in the vocals
Hood story, everybody going loco
Gotta put a pussy nigga in a chokehold
No joke that's the code of survival
Battle royal - everybody your rival
In the ghetto everybody going psycho

I'm a maniac, Brainiac when I'm aiming at
Knock your brain out the hat while I cop that
You can't block that and just (?)
Stop that, you ain't 'bout that
Said my loud niggas where ya hoes at
Double sacks and a couple packs put ya daughter's fingers in a mouse trap
Off that cause we on what
Can't come back like you stole somethin'
Nigga might as well, let me hold somethin'
Before I take that and your ho for frontin'
Blew a (?) like smoke somethin'
Sippin' OG, might roll somethin'
Pop a bottle, might toast somethin'
Nigga keep hatin', I'mma toast somethin'
Weapon off that black and decker
Putting lean in my Dr Pepper
Chess shit and you playing checkers
Hit the chest (?)
Mac attack on that ho shit, might walk around, get your throat split
If you don't know shit, better know this
F*ck around, hocas-pocus
You in focus, I'm a locust, see them big pictures and stay focused
Your ho luck atrocious, my bitches look ferocious
Breakin' shit psychosis, you niggas talkin' about practice
Roll around with that acid, if you don't know start askin'
Middle man be taxin', made a couple hundred, kept stackin'
Know it sound like I'm braggin' but know you do got (?)

Communication cannot calmly converse
Demographics delegated dissoluted diverse
Evidently eventually everything ends 
First fascinate friends force foes to fend
Gradually the greater good grows and graduates

The king of corrupt kings keeps killing kids
Live for life and love levitating lids
Money makes many mens minds miss
Nevermind newness now we need nourish
Oppose only one organization
Pray and protect the peaceful population

Think you better be ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Cause we warring
All you fucking yellow comets running from the front line
If anybody wanna get away hey
I'll find your fucking ass in due time
Run and seek shelter but you never will escape
Flipping over the gate, cause you can't wait
To get your fucking ass away
But you're trapped, and there's no way out of this mushroom cloud
But you never wanna realize that I'm planted
In your mind now
Cypress Hill compound, you could hear the sound
Let another motherfucker run up
And I'll put your ass down (down)
Then I'll peal from your cap the Cypress Hill star
Quick look around, you can't hide
You just might die right where you are

With these niggas who be puffin on the Dutch

Can it be, it's just a dream when you're on your scene smoking the green
Cause ain't shit never what you think it seem
From the streets where life ain't cheap
Cypress Hill, Soul Assassins, while you asking, ""Who that rapping?""
We get all up inside your grill, with the skill
Shoot to kill when it's time for action
See you can't hide, from this homicide, that ain't no lie
Better kiss that black ass goodbye
When you try to play these wiseguys
So who's complaining when we intensify the levels on the rhyme
You better get ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Because we are the wild

Beyond your comprehension
Blunt session, you feel the tension begin to rise
F*ck and feed him, if they can't take a joke
And get high
I'm feeling lye, in my lungs, what the deal bro?
So many people wanna hit my joint
But they never got none

Ah, heute lass' ich den Job (Job)
Gott, ich hasse den Trott (Trott)
Noch so'n paar Tage mehr
Man ich schwör', dann platzt mir der Kopf
Immer nur funktionier'n nach Regeln und Listen
Will inmitten der Schnappschüsse mal das Leben erwischen
Und bin weg, weit weg, da wo dir Fehler verzeihbar sind
An den Ort, wo wir mit 16 dachten, wo wir mit 30 sind
Kein Ärgern und Mist, denn als merkten wir's nicht
Alltag ist Treibsand, du steigst ab, je stärker du trittst
Immer nur langleben von Mahnung zu Mahnung und Ratenabzahlung
Für ein Mal im Jahr, 14 Tage Malle
Ich bin raus, kann schon nach dem Ende 'nen Anfang sehen
Ganz egal, wie lang' der Fall, solange die Landung steht
Vielleicht Saint Tropez, vielleicht weit hinter den Bergen
Vielleicht nur Bielefeld, doch dort, wo noch Grinsen was wert ist
Endlich Laufen lernen
Endlich angefangen, aufzuhör'n (Ah)

Und heute bin ich aufgewacht
Augen aufgemacht
Sonnenstrahlen im Gesicht, halte die Welt an
Und bin auf und davon (Hey)
Auf und davon (Hey)
Auf und davon (Hey)

Und heute bin ich aufgewacht
Augen aufgemacht
Sonnenstrahlen im Gesicht, halte die Welt an

Das Erfüllen ist schwer (schwer)
Bin den Krach so gewohnt, für mich Stille nun Lärm
Kann und will das nich' mehr, in Fabrikhallen eingeschlossen
Als wär' mir das Leben dort am Fließband vorbeigeschossen
Tag ein, Tag aus, da rein, da raus
Unentwegtes Hundeleben, ja, nein, brach aus
Hauptsache Miete passt, Hauptsache Kitaplatz
Stotter' das Leasing ab, jeden Morgen von sieben an
Murmeltiertag leben, zu Jesus beten, treu zur Frau
Fleißig und produktiv, ewig lebt der deutsche Traum
Bin ab heute raus, Zeit, um zu gehen
Soweit es mich trägt, verbrannte Brücken leiten den Weg
Mach' mein eigenes Ding, keine Last mitzutragen
Der Trick is' atmen, die Antwort einfach nich' zu fragen (Ah)
Endlich Laufen lernen
Endlich angefangen aufzuhör'n

"Ich wollte grade bleiben auf meinem Weg hier raus
Jetzt, wo ich fast am Ziel bin, merk ich, es geht nicht auf
Wenn das 'ne Prüfung ist, ich nehm's in Kauf
Ich seh wie diese Menschen Hass kriegen, nur durch den Mercedes-Sound
Mein Plan war's irgendwann hier raus zu schaffen
Jetzt wollen sie Auge machen
auf dem Weg zu 100.000 Platten
Zehn Millionen Klicks und die Probleme beginnen jetzt
Ignorieren ist der Weg, raus aus diesem Spinnennetz
Es sind die eigenen Komplexe, die sie scharf machen
So, als hätt' ich Mord begang', Erfolg war meine Tatwaffe
Gnadenlos, allesamt nur schadenfroh
Doch stehen diese Menschen ganz alleine vor mir war das alles gar nicht so
Ich behalte den Fokus und lass mich nicht mehr bremsen
Die Macht in meinen Händen, in der Stadt eine Legende
Rebell solang ich kämpfe
auch wenn sie mich zutiefst hassen
Wollt es nur ans Ziel schaffen und meine Musik machen
Jetzt wollen sie glücklich werden durch meine Vernichtung
Verhasst in jede Richtung, geblendet von der Missgunst
Schreibe mit Feuer und hab deshalb an der Hand Verbrennung'
Redet was ihr wollt, euer Neid ist meine Anerkennung

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde
Yeah, ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität

Riech den Neid in der Luft, dir bleibt nur noch Frust
Weil sich auf der weiten Welt kein Schwein für dich juckt
Ich bin oben angekommen und das bereit dir Druck
Doch in Wahrheit macht dich dein eigenes Leid nur kaputt, Bruder
Deine Denkweise, guck, sie macht voll keinen Sinn
Du kriegst das Kotzen, wenn du hörst, dass ich erfolgreich bin
Jetzt ist es offiziell, KC ist der Überflieger
Je höher ich komme, fällst du in deiner Psyche tiefer
Seitdem ich auf der Zwei war, seh ich so viel Neid
Ungerechtigkeit macht sich breit auf dem Weg zur Eins
Wenn Blicke töten könnten, würd' ich jetzt im Grab liegen
Sie würden gerne den Plan schmieden und scharf schießen
Sie wollen dich runterreißen, von der Karriereleiter
Wegbegleiter, die sich wünschen, dass du in dei'm Leben scheiterst
Was willst du machen, wenn sich Neid in deiner Gegend breit macht?
Ich bet für alle meine Feinde an jedem Freitag
Du bist besessen, in dein' Träumen siehst du mich verrecken
Doch ich bin Rebell, ich bin hart, ich bin nicht zu brechen
Und wenn es sein muss, schieß' ich mit der Smith & Wesson
Ich fick den Richter, weil nur Gott richtet, und das dürft ihr nicht vergessen

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde

"Was ist mit uns passiert, du bist mir fremd geworden
Ich gucke dich an und fühle ich bin bei dir nicht geborgen
Wir beide wollten reden, jetzt streiten wir uns wieder
Wenn du ehrlich bist, weißt du, dass ich das nicht verdient hab'
Ich kriege so langsam Angst, dass du nicht mehr lieben kannst
Dass du Gefühle, die ich habe nicht erwidern kannst
Es macht mich krank, wenn du sagst, dass das nicht stimmt
Du redest vom großen Glück, doch verhältst dich wie ein Kind
Warum tust du mir das an, woher kommt der Hass in dir
Ich wollte nicht erkennen, dass ich meine Platz verlier'
Der Platz in deinem Herzen, bis tief in deine Seele
Jetzt sitzen deine Blicke wie ein Strick um meine Kehle
Du hörst mir nicht mehr zu, ich habe keine Bedeutung mehr
Meine Gedanken fliegen durch den Raum kreuz und quer
Du fürchtest dich, es ist okay, wenn du deswegen fliehst
Besser du gehst jetzt bevor du meine Tränen siehst

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Ich fahre nach Hause jetzt, ich habe sie losgelassen
Wäre ich ein Mädchen, würde ich diesen beiden Strophen hasse
Ich komme nicht klar mit ihr, ich komme nicht klar mit mir
Ich weiß noch wie ich sie gesehen habe in diesem Laden hier
Sie las die Zeitung und trank ihren Milchcafé
Ich wusste, dass ich jetzt die Mutter meiner Kinder seh'
Und als sie plötzlich lachte klang es wie Engelsstimmen
Es klang so bitter-süß, als ob die kleinen Engel singen
Denn es ist Fakt, dass diese Frau etwas Besonderes ist
Und wenn sie guckt ist es, als ob man dann die Sonne vergisst
Dieses Geschenk Gottes
Und man vermisst eine Person erst plötzlich dann, wenn der Moment fort ist
Wenn man den Anruf kriegt und sie im Koma liegt
Es holt dich runter, als ob man gar kein Koka zieht
Ich hau ein Loch in die Wand mit der blanken Faust
Ich hab Angst, Angst vor der Fahrt in's Krankenhaus

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Ich glaube du kannst mich hören, ich bin jetzt hier bei dir
Wir beide wissen zwischen uns beiden ist viel passiert
Wie du hier liegen musst und künstlich beatmet wirst
Egal was war, heute bleibe ich, bis dein Atem stirbt
Die Mediziner sagen heute wirst du von uns gehen
Ich höre dein schwaches Herz schlagen und mir kommen die Tränen
Ich wollte noch so viel sagen, ich wollte es in Ordnung bringen
Ich wollte, dass du merkst wie ernst mir diese Worte sind
Ich weiß, die Engel werden sich gut um deine Seele sorgen
Und auch ein Schmetterling wird kommen wie an jenem Morgen
Lass deine Ängste hier, nimm meine Hoffnung mit
Ich weiß für jeden Menschen ist der Tod ein Kompromiss
Ich würde mein Herz geben
Ich würde dich bis in den Himmel tragen, 
Dich dort schlafen legen und den Schmerz nehmen
Doch das ist deine Reise, ich kann dich nicht begleiten
Gott will, dass ich bei dieser reise nicht dabei bin

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Scheiß auf meine Lehre, ich kann da leider nichts lern', das is' verrückt
Ich führte Kriege gegen Brüder und fing mir paar Narben ein

"Yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah

Whatever's asked to me I perform,
I rip through the rain into the eye of the storm,
Still carrying the flame, eye of the torch,
Failure comes at a price I can't afford,
Never been half hearted I put my all in,
Forfeited all just to answer my calling,
Wearing the scars of the wars that I fought in,
Should'a been heading for the stars but I'm falling,

I have your
If you need them I'll be swimming in the lake,
Oh baby don't look down, just take the crown.

Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.

I fought till I had the fight left,
Risked my death,
Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps,
My strengths water enough,
To wash away any of the stains on my rep,
Yeah, I fought off voulcher's,
Went against odds when I was short and soldiers,
I asked not for my burden to be lightened
But if I may have broader shoulders
So as I may carry the weight all the doubt I had in me has been ?
So from now til the day I'm carried away
I will never walk around what stands in my way
F*ck if they ain't letting off cos neither will I
When I die from the ashes any ?
Long as my ? and my faith keep me alive
Fear is something you will see in my eyes.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,
When everything was wrong and everything was gone
We ran to Avalon.

I left competion out for the count no abacus
Fought for the crowd, fought down challengers
When my massacre was ordained
I remained through pain forged my sword, my Excalibur.

We'll be kings forever, oh oh oh,
Holding on together, oh oh oh,
Feeling so much better oh oh oh,

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John

People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
Niggas, take off your coats ladies, act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
Ludicrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
On my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out, so let me get back 'cause I'm wettin niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothas
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case
I have a quest to have the mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when the Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want something here
Make something deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Wild Style took it to trial said it's all his fault

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
My cons-tributions to this jam
Is confusing because I am...
... low key and y'all know the deal
And when you real then you real no need to ice grill
YES, I'm nice still, YES, my mic skills
is so ill for real give myself slight chills
And I get money, money I got
Big bottles of Belve keep the bloodflow hot
Bone's up in queen, wood in the feds
Wild born and barred niggaz hold your head
Cause I'm still here, hustle with no fear
The muscle is still here that love be still sheer
I dare, a muh'fucker pull my card
I got more than a great big bodyguard
So press up if you wanna get served
I survived in the hood, now I'm all in the burbs
With the bass on thump, suitcase in the trunk
Probably UV with the tooly lettin Akon pump

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
How long can I lay to touch millions
'fore that AK spray or sprays on civilians
I'm five for five, I'm rated R
I'm gifted, and I'm goin far
Down the ave, to the spot
Four dubs of 'dro that's all I copped
No mo' but chammy that's all I pop
So solo with the fam that we all we got
Hate for what, I live that life
I done drove every car, I did that ice
Done touched a few broads, some hid they wife
I was too large to dodge, had to deal my life
I kept it fair, I played the game
Now it's time for the whole world to know my name

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say? Why catch feelings
Just do the dance that's easy to do
Lean back or that two-step, what's easy for you
This jam is on and on and on
Guaranteed airplay 'til your breath is gone!

I get the money so I don't care, I do-I don't care, I do-I don't care
New York get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care

I heard that nigga Capone's home yo...
Word to Motha..that nigga Nore'
Doin' his mothafuckin' thing...thugged out

Ill Will, Braveheart nigga, there's a thin line between streets and business..
So we gotta have balance and be easy...

I heard you fags want to catch me off guard
Put Tecks to my heart, the death of Escobar
Under your breath, whispers in the dark
I hear it 'cause the street ain't loyal to choose sides

Prepare for the beef, whoever lose dies
Rich and I'm thuggin'
I can't trust nothin', this bitch that I'm fuckin'
This clip that I'm bustin' could jam in my fist

Look at my hand, finger pussy with expensive rings
Cut coke cookies, wrote poetry and broke noses B.
The voice from Heaven 

I'm God sent, of course a legend
This is part 1, speak my sermon, the hood reverend
Blunted eyes red
C-Class, a Hundred times Five Red

CD's blast, speed fast, haters drop dead
I'm gorgeous
black Goddess flip the arm rest, flip the cordless 
Her body stacks the best, ass is flawless
Finally the long awaited shit, ghetto people the sequel
Nas, CNN, nobody's equal. 

[Chorus] 
Yo, Be easy
Keep the club off the heezy
Straight thugs in the back, drink creezy
Be easy, but we still smoke treezy
See us rippin' the shows with thugged easy.

Niggas picked me the boss
Ricky Ross
Lex Two-Fifty Horse power, click and devour the source
If it's flour then swallow your loss

I cock Fours, kick in Poppi's doors
All for the cash and the cause
Niggas break big fractions of laws
So what, we got it sewn up, smack every cat on the board

I speak the truth, guns spit at you, shakin' my palm
It's pitiful, wavin' my wand
The Don, a hundred follow me like Farrakhan
Chasin' my Henny, embrace Benny's

It's quite Frank, my niggas will kill, never waste a Penny
Money stay well invested
Feel the weight on my necklace
When death is too close flip the next shit

Thug the game out
Bust biscuits, pull the Range out
Public enemy, Queens Bridge where I hang out
Sweet scent of weed I wear like a fragrance
My energy's kinetic, mind power type ancient.

[Chorus]

I see death through the corner, die, kingdom come
Six 500's, pull up right in front of the slum
Sticky green fingers soldiers of the great God
Clarence spoke to the poor but he lived in Oz

An ill hook like Roy Jones, I'm a street corner bastard
And crush weed with the hashish
Bandanna head dome wrapped
Caddy trucks with the grills and the chrome snaps

I'm on point like Al Sharpton, come peep the M.U. marksman
The S-Class is shittin' on your weak Datsun
Graffiti written on the Bible, my life is wicked
I see dead corpses, and Rolls Royces

Put your heart on your lap, listen you hear voices 
My whole persona is the drama and to smoke skama
I can lift it up, Willy what in front of your slut
Money bustin' out my pocket, your bank is stopped

Doing things just to touch the cream

Ass smacked, legs wide, front back, side to side,
Pussy wet, Slip-N-Slide, yup everything gonna be alright

Just mind your business
These rumors are senseless
Your whispers are endless

This girl is hella bad
Your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores
You saw me grace the Source
You watched me work the Vibe
Bitches I works for mine
One time for these divas
Two times for these Visa's
Third time I come I'm breezing
The ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up I'ma keep it going

A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll

"Yeah, I say
Bitch bad, woman good, lady better
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five maybe four
Ridin' 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm that bitch
Something that's far above average""
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word ""bitch"" with his mama comma
And because she's relatin' to herself, his most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches) Uh, tell 'em
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches)

Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the internet watchin' videos listenin' to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the internet better than their parents
Now being the internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches""
Now let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens
High heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say (I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

Disclaimer, this rhymer, Lupe, is not usin' ""bitch"" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretion's, reflections, it's clever misdirection
'Cause, while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sure enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna f*ck her
He think she's bad at bein' a bitch, like his mother
Momma never dressed like that, come out the house hot mess like that
Ass, titties, breasts like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play your part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch, what a double entendre

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say (I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

Bitch bad, woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
You're misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches)

What's up party people in the place to be
Gather round for a minute and check the MC
I really don't know what you expectin from me
But I was born and raised to rock over the beat
See, me and my homies got some tight-ass raps
It is time we put the hometeam back on the map
All you radio stations play a whole lotta crap
It's like I'm hungry at the table and you feedin me scrap
So this one's for the people who can ride the wave
And go into the battle and come out unscathed
See, my only regret is that I probably never gave
Enough back to hip-hop for the life it saved
So ride along with us as we lick this shot
For anybody who put it down, we never forgot
See, we give it all we got, cause it's how we was taught
And it only takes a second just to blow up the spot

We keep it lit like weed, indeed the rare breed
They barely did enough of us for their needs
Our fans, some r&b, most hip-hop and rave
I'm dark-skinned, baby, and I get you sun-bathed
Once the track's laid that Jissm made
I become a slave to the beat, don't know how to behave
We kept it true, what else did you expect us to do?
Now I'm beggin you to come and spin a record or two
I'm on the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
 
To you so-called MC's who want to get bold
You'll be showed in the worst ways
I'm seasoned for battle cause of Project Blowed Thursdays
I'm a wordsmith, now that we've settled into two thou
(Two thou) we gotta represent somehow (somehow)
It's talent in the ghetto that we'll have to employ
With melanin in em they'll seek to destroy

be	-boys in the place, just had to show my face
Soon after that I discovered my instrument
As soon as I picked her up we got intimate
Big up to my homeboys who know this tune

I wanna be swept of my feet

Friday night she wore his jersey to the game
In the front row screaming out his name
As he turns to her and smiles
Everywhere I look people holdin' hands
When am I gonna get my chance at love
My chance at love 

Shes with him
I'm still hurting
Try to pretend but its not working
I just wanna be
Where they are

My heart is waiting for your love
My hand is waiting for your touch
My lips just wanna be kissed by you

I wanna be blown away
I wanna be swept of my feet
I wanna meet the one that makes it hard for me to breathe
I wanna be lost in love
I wanna be a dream come true
Wanna be scared of how strong I feel for you
Just call me beautiful
Call me beautiful

Lemme tell you where I grew up at
Sip mo', threw up at, flip coke, blew up that
Where them fake thugs got they vest-es chewed up at
Brooklyn beef! Who want that?

I grew up in the thoroughest borough - B.K.
Where B.I.G. had everybody rockin' D.K.
Gav was the first dude with the C.L.K.
And bricks was gettin' shipped outta East L.A.
It's Brooklyn, where niggaz lives was tooken 
Rich cats got knocked and they wallets was tooken
Fort Greene and Hemlock, the fifth been cocked
We cried when they killed Lenox and popped them rocks
(Aiyyo, ya ain't hear, what {the f*ck} I just said?)
B.K. - the home of Biggie and Jay
Where niggaz got Will Smith chips, get jiggy all day
Bitches that boost in the city all day
Heckel and Koch, crack spots, federal watch
I grew up here, sip Mo', threw up here
Yo the feds snatched two up here, in B.K.
Niggaz in the hood in that all blue and grey
Gorillas got rich from stairwells and P.A.

[Chorus: x2]

Brooklyn!  The livest borough
You come here frontin' you might die in this borough
The East, the feelin' Bed-Stuy's in this borough
It's full of projects, the wildest borough
Try to figure out which side is thorough
From, C.I. to Saint Marks is carryin cons
Niggaz rock Coogi and Dolce Gaban's
So women here make a livin' just carryin' bombs
We pop, corks a little bit and we floss a little bit
In the club, buyin' out Cris', pour us a little bit
I told y'all that my borough is thorough
I know niggaz that'll clap you up and bury the metal
Same day, still in the hood we so, ghetto
Brook-Nam, holla back, get your crook on
Live from the seven-one-eight, we raised the eight
Every time papi raise the weight of that weight, motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]

It's B.K. nigga, get yo' vest ate up
Over them chips, you could get S-Ked up
They find you in the back of the buildin' - sprayed up
All for the love of this paper; we misled
By 21 - some'll be dead
By 22 - the rest of these dudes'll be in the Feds
We got change but we still FUCKED up
Niggaz is outta jail but they still locked up
The feds takin flicks when we pullin' the drops up
BK open up, get popped up
You know it's the borough where cats drive with the box in the truck
Tre' pound glocked up, wrist be rocked up
Yellin' out ""Get down, lay down when we pop up!""
Blocks so hot we drive the drops with tops up
Windows tinted, you can't see who is in it
It's Brown nigga, I represent it, it's Brooklyn!

My team full of cut throats with enough notes to write a f***in' book
Take a good f***ing look at these bad guys
Stay mad fly, mad high 
In the Ford Expidie, and I don't expect to die 
On some humble s***
I am on some rumble s***
When it's on, you should see the s*** I come through with
If you scared, by dog, release the four by fours 
I heard the fagot-a** Don died, and he s*** in his drawers
On the streets, black; good like Allstate

Just got paid, but f*** it, I want some more cake

Now ya nervous, man, and drive my brains quick fast at ya service

Get it ripped apart

I came all the way from Cuba just to babalu ya
On a raft to the river, from the river on to ya
Steppin like a prisoner who came por El Mariel
With a mission incomplete, cause I didn't kill Fidel
I brought a conga drum and some Celia Cruz records
My mother had me dressed in high-water pants with checkers
Talkin 'bout, ""Oye niño, no te hagate porfiado""
""Grow up and make some records, so you don't have to live quemado""
So now I'm that kid that brought the Spanglish lingo, baby
With a guayabera shirt and a hat that drove you crazy
Ladies tried to play me, so I had to play em back
And called em mentirosa, but I'm fly and attract
Now I'm a mega, ???, you see me on the pista
Talkin 'bout Spanish Fly, my man, ???
And all my boys sit around and call me coy
They gave me the name of Babalu Bad Boy

Check out the way I do my thing
Yo, I move and shake and bake it
Cause that's the way I make it
I never front a move and everything just come butt-naked
I lift it, uplift it, and shift it nifty
Change my flow with two words you don't know
Like mentirosa, mañana otra cosa
And like I got your girlie hangin by the chocha
Hangin and we're swingin it
I think she like the way I came this year
Oh what a cha cha, I mean what a muchacha
Dancin to my hip-hop like it was some salsa
But yo, this chumpie is comin sorta funky
And Mellow is your mellow that be swingin like a monkey

A little salsa into my samba
A little mambo into my bongo

"From the day that I saw you
I knew that we would pursue
'Cause the chemistry we felt that day
Felt so real and so true
Looking back on a year we spent together
How it's been,
What we went through
Although we've had our
Little ups and downs
We've still pulled through

Baby girl you're my world
My everything
I want to lace you with diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you dream and fantasize
'Cause you can tell me
That you love me looking in my eyes
You keep it real with me
I keep it real with you
You keep on loving me
I'll keep on loving you
Keep doing what you do
I feel your whole aura
And I can't wait to hook up
Again tomorrow baby
What

My love for won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy

Every time I look at you
I can't believe
I've found a love so true and
I took time to put
My trust in you
I must admit it was so hard to do
And every minute that I spend with you
You make me believe
I have nothing to loose and
Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine

Do you believe in destiny?
Because I got a funny feeling
This was meant to be
Without you I'd be lost,
I need you next to me
Preferably in a house full
Of luxuries and little kids
From day one I was sprung,
Knew you was gonna be the one
'Cause my heart spoke for the
Very first time in a long while
And every time you smile, I can see
Us walking up the aisle with you
Carrying my child
C'mon

My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy

If you were to go, I don't know
You're the only one who
Sweeps me off my feet
Makes my soul go week
The only one who makes
My heart want to beat and I,
I could never live without you
You know that what I feel
Has to be true
'Cause you're my, my sweet love

Ever since the first time,
That I looked into your eyes
I knew that you were
Gonna be mine
Feeling you from the inside
When you're not by my side
You're the only girl
That's on my mind
I never knew a love like this,
A long so strong
A vision so picture perfect
It could never be wrong
Along the way, you're gonna
See you belong wit Jay
I might have to marry you one day baby eh

"Baby don't cry
I hope you got your head up 
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry
I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Keep ya head up)

Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat
So when she asked me: ""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated
They chased, and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

Baby, please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up

Forget him, girl, (forget him, girl) he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater, but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin' mo')
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you 'bout to have his baby? (damn)

They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

I don't why but I keep going back (back)

And I ain't doing nothing but making her thirst for me

Hard motherfucking habit to break man

I know it ain't right.. that's what it is!

See I'll be damned
If I let my son call another man daddy
And if you feel like I feel that's

But I just can't stand to see her with nobody else
I know it's bad, but I can't help myself

Went to the crib, did what we did till about six in the morning
Wasn't thinking bout having no kids
Just thinking bout getting it on and
On and on, and on and on and onnnn
That's how I got where I'm at right now
Let me take it back right now
She was there for me, everytime I needed
Even when I got a little lonely
Wasn't even like she was my girl
She was more like my little homie
It's deeper deeper than you'll ever know!
Sometimes you lose control
The hardest thing to get up out ya system is that

Oh Lord it's getting crucial!
And being truthful I don't understand it
I just won't have it!
Her out wit another nigga in the bar
My son wit another nigga in the car

Like I'm just gon be tolerating this man
Playing dad, see I pay the bills
I'll tap the phone, I catch ya here again
Homie we gon have a problem
Let it be known, I might not stay here
But this is my home, leave it alone!

Ain't nuttin' new up under the sun
She want a boy
I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryin to get my funds count my ones

[Chorus]

Nuttin' new up under the sun
Got a brother up under the gun
Better run cause a girl got a plan to get a man
Ain't a ring on my hand
All she wants is me and her to be one

Uh, let me tell you how the story begun
At first thought she was the one
She was chill then so much fun
Her uzi weighed a ton
Didn't know I was chillin with a loaded gun
Can you feel or hear me son
Disappear reappear call me hang up
Love me hate me quit me date me
Baby on the low might Robert Blake me

You want your problem solved holla dog
Can't be seen with her in the mall
Givin' you a piece of my catalogue
Never thought you would pull up at a broad
But I had it y'all
Bagged it y'all
Hate it when a girl get mad at y'all
I'm savage y'all
Don't panic nah
The reason why a fly nigga haven't called

[Chorus]

Ain't nuttin' new up under the sun
No money no car why you call me a bum
Cause you got cake and I'm scrapin' crumbs
Now I'm on the video your face look stunned

[Chorus]

Nutin up under the sun
Fellas succumb when they nails and they hair get done
It's better for some to tell'em when young
Keep'em under space in the place til they head get spun

I can't mess wit you hoes
Out to get my dough
Alterior with the mo
From my heart the plot is closed
You know
You thought since I was nice
Since I was blind like some mice
But I'm a man with that vice
Baby please get it right

All of us used to walk the world
Akward scared to talk to girls
Every flavor even chocolate swirl
Can't get a housewife from a stalker girl
Ah ah
Cannot handle a high caliber woman
Camera hold steady
A blast and I'm a move it around
Tryin take advantage and vanish for standing how I'm a get down

[Chorus]

Ain't nutin new up under the sun
She want a boy
I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryin to get my funds count my ones

[Chorus]

Uh, I'm a break it down real real quick
Just cause she fine don't mean she fine
In the time it took me to write this rhyme
Baby done slept with all man kind
Don't play me play lotto
You can't rip it like no throttle
Get yo ass up out that bottle girl
Stuck up in some model world

Let me spit this man
With miss thang
Put it in the way just to get this Jane
Sorry girlfriend I forgot your name
Don't blame me just blame the game

Your claim to fame ain't your brain
Without no game her end can't complain
She don't wanna make the change
She just wanna shake that thing and chase that fame

[Chorus x2]",Baby Please,Rap
"Before you came around I asked myself
What is this thing called love
There were clouds, the rain kept pouring down
Then you brought the sun, yes you did
Showed me all the differences
Between a woman and a girl
Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

I don't need to take a toke
'Cause I'm on a natural high
Everybody's blowing smoke

And you nourished me, encouraged me
'Till I grew tall as a tree, as a tree
You had patience to search
Find and bring out all the best in me, yes you did
You see things I couldn't see
My mental potential
Girl you showed me, yeah
Now it's a reality
And I promise for you I'm gonna be all that I can be

And father will be pacing the floor

Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, Sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?

Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow

M’alzo dal letto
Faccio colazione, cappuccino e cornetto
Non ricordo bene cosa ho fatto e che ho detto
Ieri in ""presa bene"", forse un po’ sotto effetto
Oggi in spiaggia la ganja, due tiri a calcetto
Prendiamo da bere, ce l’ho io il braccialetto
Due consumazioni e mi si butta sul petto
Mi son risparmiato anche l’approccio diretto
Io già me la immagino ad angelo retto
Sciolgo i suoi capelli e penso a darci dentro
Lei si fa i castelli che neanche un architetto
Io sono un bastardo e non dimostro rispetto
Mi hai scelto, comprendi il concetto diretto
Scendo con la mano e tento il colpo diretto
Lei mi tira il cocktail spaccandomi il setto
È lo stesso uccello in fondo a farci da tetto
E l’ammetto, nessuno è perfetto

Ma no, e allora baciami
Prima che parta il treno
Se vuoi risorgeremo
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho
Cosa resta di noi?
Da quando qualche parte andremo
E se non è sereno
Tu già lo sai che ti perdonerò
Io ti perdonerò

Hai un talento
So che la vedrò allo stesso stabilimento
Mi avvicinerò gettando gli alibi al vento
Le chiederò scusa per il comportamento
Immaturo, ti giuro che già me ne pento
Ho un materassino, andiamo a largo un momento
Io che do uno sguardo al suo sedere scoperto
La prova costume lei la passa con cento
Già sento gli ormoni in fermento
Svengo, prendimi come se fossi un tuo complimento
Esci questa sera, dammi un appuntamento
Lei mi dice ""ho le valigie pronte in albergo
Se non mi saluti mi offendo""

I f*ck bad broads live large and drive V's
Some say I'm cocky and rude I might be
But nigga f*ck you, you ain't got to like me
I'm at the bar taking sips of long island ice tea
Wrist looking' blue or icy I'm pricey
Bitch niggas mean mugging' and starin' all shiesty
Don't make me pepper spray your face have you lookin' all spicy
Cause I know you niggas hatin' and want to fight me
Thinking I'm all Hollywood like Spike Lee
Thinking I'ma steal you and f*ck up your white T
When I catch you in your jaw I'ma f*ck up your white teeth
But nigga I be ready to scuffle like dice peat
And ya'll walkin' outta this tussle ain't likely
I hope you boys ready to rumble I'm quite deep
And I ain't friendly but I'ma tell you politely

Say I'm the type of cat  when I pull up in the place
you hatas like a blow job put it in they face
I buy the goochie shoes matching belt lookin' great
Dubs sounding cool you can tell I'm pushin' weights
Courtier full of flakes snow storms in the peaks
Hoe taming nigga keep my bitch on a leash
You the typa cat that'll chase a chick for weeks
Then try to box a nigga when you hear he hit your freak
But playa don't you know you outta line that shit is weak
And fightin' over broads will get you killed up in these streets
You running round here plexin' always thinking shit is sweet
Then have the nerve to wonder why them bullets hit ya cheek
Then want to step to me talkin' but (Oh you foul!)
All up in my face talking bout (You hit my gal)!
I'm looking at him stupid like man this shit is wild
You better give me space asshole I ain't ya pal

I keep my game on face when I'm riding on chops
Straight gorilla pimp don't even wave to the bops
Lookin' like a snail crawlin' slow through the lot
Fist full of grain other hand on the glock
Cause when you want fee jackers want what you got
That's why I stay ready with the inferred dot
The first one to jump is the first getting shot
Put the beam on his head then I take off his block
You love to rob O like take off you rocks
Take off your shoes playa take off your socks
But I'm the type of cat before I take off my watch
Aim at your chest and try to take off you heart
You know how I do playa shake off tha marks

It's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go, and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know

We're gonna set the mood (set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove (go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah

Here, we say now
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it
Back in the day, back in the day
Oh baby
Back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day
I'll do it
Back in the day, back in the day

Oh yeah

Y'all remember back in the day, you dig
Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald

Yeah
Now 'Chain Of Fools' and 'Respect'
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said
'What's Going On,' 'Let's Get It On'
Such classic songs; don't forget them
Though times have changed
They still remain my inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door

We're gonna set the mood
(We're gonna set the mood)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(Go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
(Rewind, another time)
When the originators, innovators were alive

So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday

Open your mind, enjoy the ride
Live out tonight, and grab that soul train

So get up, relive it
Gotta let yourself flow

Come celebrate
Just get up, get on it
Get yourself on the floor
Don't back away (don't back away)
Come celebrate (gonna celebrate, yeah)

So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life

Back in the days (3X)
Back in the days (2X)

Back in the days of eighty-three
Breakdancin at the crib with my man Dupri
When the Saturday nights was LIVE in the West
When honies were fly, the flavor was good but
on the burnt side, was where it took place
On the cheap sound system without no bass
Coolin with my man DayDay, the DJ Machete
I want a record deal, but I knew I wasn't ready
But back then I still had more fun
I even rode around my guy the rookie named Michael Jordan
Long before Tag Team and 95 South
Real Planet Rock shit used to funk the house
But the schoolyard Crips and PPD's were too rowdy
Some of them started rollin to the ?dotua? parties
My dance group called the Frat Boys was winnin
The parties was live cause General Lee was spinnin
When the summer came I was off to the Ridge
With my pen and my pad, I met new kids
Marty Mar, a.k.a. the Big Mo
Big Ben, Af Rock, yo we stole the show
Makin tapes all the time, it's like I couldn't quit
But when I listen to em now I'll admit
That it wasn't alla that in fact we was wack
But every now and then, huh, I want to go back

Back in the days
I want to go back in the days (4X)
I want to go back (2X)

Spring eighty-seven, down with the four man crew
cool Kat, Disco, and my man Steve Blue
No record deal, but I was still rhymin
Big Mo hooked me with a kid named Diamond D
Not the one from the East he went to school in Arizona
said he liked the way I rocked the microphone-a
We knew our, producer, but he was a flake
That lived in the projects, said we had to wait
Sittin in the car for hours at a time, buckin bullets down
But that's how bad I wanted to rhyme
Back when the hip-hop shit always had the airplay
The best station in nation which was KDAY
I got serious about my flow
Hooked up with a brother that they call Domino
And Diamond quit and left the twelve, over at my crib
I hooked it up to my cassette player, tell you what I did
I would pause mix breaks, whatever it would take
I only had three records couldn't dig in any crates
And there was times when I wanted to stop flowin but my
best friend and lover Ajay, yo, she said to keep goin
When all we had to eat was cup of noodles in the six pack
Cause I went and spent all my ducats on the six track
On the real, no food in the fridge
But when I won the rap contest at Northridge
Everybody flipped, yo we didn't know how to act
Daaam, I want to go back

I want to go back
I want to go back in the days (6X)

Bill Duke, a well known deep brother
Hooked me with the soundtrack on Deep Cover
That's how I met Belial, from the Bronx
He had more beats that house niggaz got conks
Showed me all kind of beat makin tricks
Just like Machete showed me how to pause mix
and I was married to the shit like a husband to a wife
But when I tried to rhyme up at the Good Life
Yo I got dissed I couldn't buy no respect
But in two years I came back to catch wreck
On the set and jet, cause that's how it had to be
And my man Tragedy became amazed at me
So he put me inside, the Cadillac
The chaffeur drove off, and now I can't go back
Hahaha, back in the days

I want to go back in the days (6X)
I want to go back (4X)",Back in the Day,Rap

Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vexed at it, why'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday

Uh, why'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a F*CK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope
[GZA]
We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope why'all niggaz is armed
And when we get there, all my niggaz in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich

Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggaz with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me

This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her

"[Chorus: x6]
Back to the grill again, the grill again 

[MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optomistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip lines that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery

Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And that will get you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the cark, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it

And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grants
'Cause they can step to some sisters and say ""Slap me some skins""

Honey dip, and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick em in the grill

[Chorus]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin
I'm a drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it

So, so, so, where did you go, what do ya know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)

R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets nuff props

Well, anyway, Imma slay slay lay
Pull a hoe around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

[Nas]
Finesse, keep a Tech-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter

This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book

For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with ghonnerea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that why'all) That why'all, kick em in the grill

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?stabbabi? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelect""
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix

Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're
Hummmmmmming, the door rings, yo I'm coming

To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder

Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious

Rapper dapper sapper, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some Coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You want to kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ah-yo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey

Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring

Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
To to G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the hoe
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio

'Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy

So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say ""Yeah I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick em in the grill

Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM! I'm racing
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is Satan, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free
Thinkin about all my homeboys behind bars
as I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everthang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin paper every day, it's all I'm trippin on
Cause ain't nothin like a ride in Californ-ia
with the top back, rollin on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
and mashin to the backyard boogie

Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]
And then we comin wit that

Chorus:

Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:

Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggaz in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The bloods shootin dice, and the crips are see walkin
Now the party is jumpin, and the crowd's gettin bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin and humpin
Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
 You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
 And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
ain't nothin but real niggaz, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
and Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin
enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin
I want homegirl over there in red
cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a hoe
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
Cause she gonna lead a backyard boogie with me
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
 Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
 Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
 Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good

Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause

"Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck

Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend for what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad no)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

Let me tell you about, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)

Du sollst's haben, wenn dir dieses Haus gefällt

Denn mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad
Mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad
Mein Chick is so bad

Ey egal wieviel Uhr, ich bin immer zu spät
Der Typ auf'm Sofa der immer nur schläft
Immer nur gähnt, Immer nur fehlt
Ey Jungs, tut mir Leid war Zeit es zu erwähnen
Ich hab doch letzten Monat diese Frau besucht
Wir waren was essen, hatten ein Rendezvous
Auf jeden Fall sie ist jetzt meine Freundin
Doch immer wenn ich bei ihr penn mache ich kein Auge zu
Aber nicht wegen Sex, ich hab Schiss (vor ihr)
Denn sie zwingt mich und sagt du kommst mit (zu mir)
Und dann erzählt sie von irgendeiner Clique
Und dass ich nicht mehr rauskomm denn alle wären informiert
Sie sagt lass uns ein Pärchen sein
Ich würde gerne rennen, doch sie sperrt mich ein
Und ich wäre ihr Ken in dem Märchenteil
Bitte, bitte penn doch heute mal als Erster ein
Shit, alles dreht sich nur um dich

Yeah sie ist so bad, ey, sie klaut' meinen Tank
Will nicht, dass ich geh, beraubt meine Bank
Stellt meinen Wecker immer drei Stunden nach
Ey, du musst mir glauben, der Scheiß hier ist wahr
Sie hat mein Handy und gibt's nicht her
Nein, ruf' nicht an denn es ist gesperrt
Und den Mac hat sie obendrein mit versteigert
Ich denke mal, dass ihr mich deshalb nicht erreicht habt
Und ja ich hab meinen Flug verpasst
Doch ich steh mittlerweile mehr als mit 'nem Fuß im Knast
Und neulich häng' ich so allein in ihrer Bude ab
Da kommen die Cops durch die Tür und sagen „Wir suchen was“
Ich sag superkrass, ich bin hier eingesperrt
Ich glaub ihr Name ist Janine und ich weiß nicht mehr
Und alles was sich hier befindet, das gehört mir nicht
Doch leider glaubt mir das der Typ von der Behörde nicht
Shit, 30 Kilo Rauschgift
Obwohl ich nicht mal kiff
Jungs glaubt mir, ich hab Schiss

Denn mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad
Mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad
Mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad
Mein Chick is so bad, so bad, so bad

Ja?
Ähm, pennst du noch?
Ich, oder was jetzt?
Oh mann, das kann doch nicht dein Ernst sein Alter
Das kotzt jeden an, dass du immer zu spät bist
Jetzt wart doch mal ey, du wirst es mir jetzt nicht glauben,
Aber, gestern Nacht, überkrass
Ey, du kennst doch noch die eine au'sm
Ne, die kennst du nicht, aber egal, auf jeden Fall die
Ey immer so blöde Ausreden,
Irgendwelche Mädchen, dir fällt immer so ein Quatsch ein
Aber ey jetzt wart doch mal die gibt's wirklich
Ey wieso sollt ich die erfinden?
Erst ist der Hund abgehauen, dann hast du den Bus verpasst
Ja ich weiß, die Geschichte war erfunden, aber die ist wirklich echt mann!
Jeder normale Mensch kann doch pünktlich sein
Ja aber wenn die, ey wenn die einfach meinen Wecker verstellt Mann!
Ey ganz ehrlich
Da kann ich doch nix dafür wenn die mein
Wenn die meinen Wecker einfach umstellt, von 9 auf 10
Oder auf 11

"A bad day

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
Got my ass cheeks stuck to a fishin' rod
Where's the dogs? Ain't no frogs
Momma cookin' breakfast with no log

I got my grub on but didn't pig out
No Thanksgivin' so we eatin', carry out
This dude came through my front door
He said I wouldn't live to see a 24

I gotta go 'cause I got on flip flops
If I sold out then my feet 'll drop
Had to stop at the red light
Everybody laughin' at my yellow dirt bike

And everything's alright
I got a beep from Sherry, she's a transvestite
Called up my homies and I'm askin' y'all
Bring twenty bottles of alcohol

Playin' football and I'm trouble
They gave me the ball, I fumbled
And I can't believe my best friend's gay
Today was a bad day

Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up

I bust my ass in the shower
Got on this fresh new baby powder
Kids, just today these fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and got my ass beat

No flexin', wooped my ass in the intersection
Till I shoot, that's the question
Went to Big Fam house to watch the Rap City
Shootin' them craps, I got 50

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
A circle a niggas, watch me all fake 'em
They beat my ass, I need nine, 9/11
They threw my ass through the back door

They took all my cash flow
Punched me in the chest and kicked me in the asshole
I just found out my best friend's gay
Today was a bad day

Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up

Left my homies, house paid
Picked up this chick, been tryin' rape since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, the pigeons is the man
And Artest fired on a fan

Took a trip to Miami
Got my ass beat at the 21st Grammy
My dick is so weak, so weak
So weak I put my own ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
He didn't hesitate to say that she didn't cum
Ridin' down seven mile coastin',  smoken on the potion
Rubbin' on some baby oil lotion

And nothin' seems to work out
She smacked me in the face and murked out
Today was like one of those bad dreams
Jackin' off with a bowl full of whip cream

Helicopter lookin' for the murderer
Two in the mornin' got the Coney Island burger
Even with the lights of the Good Year blimp
And it read Bizarre ain't shit

Drunk as hell and I'm throwin' up
Pager cut off so you know it ain't blowin' up
I found out that my best friend was gay
Today was a bad day

Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up",Bad Day,Rap
"Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relations past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

These bad dreams

Shit now I lay me down to sleep
Please god let it end once again let me live life

We can't keep dwelling on problems

'Cause I can't do another long dance with a ghost
See my head wanna come around half past midnight

How could you be so cruel 
You treat me like a fool

You never played the game to smart 
Cause you know your bad

I got a question, am I who I seem? Oh
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

Something undefined is now taking over me
Who am I to fight me for my own soul?
I’m saying yes to things that usually are no for me
I kiss the neon night and let it have control

I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

Why do I feel so free when I’m killin’ me?
I’m fallin’ to the sky caught between all the lines

I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem? Oh
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me

I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good

Clutch the Dutch these feelin’s is hard to touch
Puff enough stuff, sometimes life is rough
On the cusp of doin’ right, who I’m foolin', right?
A child of the light goin’ wild for the night
'Cause most of fights I have, yo I have with myself
A good dude, but I can do bad by myself
It's sad that I felt that I could never be
With nobody, girl you know my G
O.d. On the good life, I’m a man, it’s simple
Probably the things I been through and the evil that men do
I want my cake and eat it, heartbreak they take and leave it
The same song I’m bein’ featured, I can’t delete it
The good you can see it but you really a bad girl
Livin’ in a mad world, sometimes you want that girl
You ain’t been Madonna through the drama
If it’s comin’ back it’s karma, a queen is made to honor

I'ma smile while I give you the dial tone 
Eatin' shrimp and girls I be pimpin' 
Walk like I'm limpin' this brother ain't simpin' 
Not to mention I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions 
I get a lot of attention 
Sleepin' in sheets that's made of satin 
With one of my money makin' honies she's mixed Spanish and Latin 
She's a fly type of swinger 
Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coat hanger 
In a high rise, made for only fly guys 
With a size that attracts the ladies eyes 
Keepin' the stash and the cash flow 
Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow 
Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars 
To earn respect, collectin' bar fight scars 
Slick talkin' with a chick when I'm walkin 
Midnight stalkin', all the suckers be hawkin' 
And I max while you be waxin' your Cadillacs 
Smooth as a fax, but I can cut you like an axe 
Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner 
I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner 
On the phone cause I'm hard like stone 
Holdin' my own, cause I'm bad to the bone 

I'm gettin' cash and, ladies receive my passion 
Parties I'm crashin' with a flashy type of action 
On stage, I kick outrageous 
And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis 
I'm more dramatic than Dallas is 
More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses 
Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her 
The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers 
So what you want honey a chump or a champ? 
Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps? 
I run the game like Sega 
Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schwarzenegger 
Excitin' when I'm fightin' I'm frightenin' 
Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning 
Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie 
And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties 
'Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast 
Wrap rappers all up in the back, like a jackass 
Police want to harass me 
'Cause I got all the material that has me lookin' jazzy 
The MC patroller 
Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller 
Dead zone when I strike the microphone 
G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone 

I never needed a helpin' handin' 
I'm outstandin', type of guy, girls never abandon 
And when I'm rollin' with force, three across your belly 
Knockin' suckers out the box like I'm playin' skelly 
Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me 
And leave the barrel of it smokin' like a chimney 
Rhymes are dynamic, voice is Titanic 
Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic 
A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker 
My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker 
A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks 
When I turn thirty, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx 
Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat 
My lyrical notes float like sailboats 
I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready 
I got more bodies than Frank Netti 
Battles I win em cause I send em to hell when I begin em 
Because I put it in em like a venom 
Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen 
Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen 
Movin' around like a smooth choreographer 
Posin' my hoes in all clothes for the photographer 
On video, show I makin' your girlfriend moan

You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Psh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K
And we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up
(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (Whats up?)
Forget it, all these bad bitches always unapologetic

Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you (bad to you)",Bad [Remix],Rap
"Ahhh you don' did it now.

Your boy's a bad man
And we invadin' the streets
Make all 'em clapper-rappers scurred

Shocked the world now I'm standin' alone
I flip fools like them clamshell cellular phones
You can't help but nod ya head to the track
F*ck the watered-down rap, we be takin' it back
Give it to ya straight, ain't no chasin' it
Check ya self in the mirror, ain't no facin' it
'Cause you...playin' the roll and you plannin' to fold
This the masterplan, we got the planet on hold
We all over the streets like ya favorite sneeker
Breakin' up ya sound like a drive-through speaker
Everything that I be spittin' is strong
After I rock, fast-forward through the rest of the song
We the monkey wrench, that's gonna ruin ya plan
And don't f*ck wit John Cena, I'm a bad, bad man

When cats got one-liners, I drop several
And I think it's funny you choose
Who's in progress of runnin' in place
We makin' rules and ya'll settle
I rip rappers and take responsibility
for makin' future hall of famers look third-rate
Ya'll are lost for words like conversation on your worst first-date,
And raw beats
Creep through side streets
Loose leaf notepads
That's where rhymes leak
Punch-lines, man, don't even beg
I got knee-slapping tracks, ya'll cruisin' ya leg
You a rhyme-writer, buddy? Man, that's a joke
You ain't worthy of being my secretary, man that's a quote

And pussy rappers choked up, wit they own rhymes in they throat

Your rhymes are whack, your style is proof that the brain corrosion

Oooooh! Shit, damn shawty, look at the motherfuckin' fatty,
Come to daddy, tell me what I gotta do to get you lickin' in my custom Caddy,
Never want to let you get up out the ride,
When I first took a look my mouth was wide,
Lick a titty with them little bitty shorts you got on,
With the thigh's hangin' out tha' side,
When you work it you gone hurt these other bitches,
Hurtin' em' mean with the way you struttin',
Even though you only walkin',
You still lookin' like you shouldn't do that shit in public,
I can tell from right now what I see you workin' with,
You ain't even gotta ask for the blunt,
Booty so phat, gaps so nice, you can see tha' ass from the front,
You fittina hurt 'em how you twurk that thang,
You want me to hear when you pop it baby,
Fell in love when you came up in club, with a whole bottle of Mo',
Don't pop it baby!,
I know you got up on some rump shaker contest,
Let us see what you can do,
Sip a little somethin' while you bounce that ass,
Girl you gotta badunkadunk,

Now put that ass in Burberry for tha' Bently,
Now go on and put on a bikini for the Lamborghini,
Now let me see you in a car for the big grown,
Love the way you shake it for the dollar,
Holla at me when you see me,
Now I don't want to see nobody full of rigimortis,
Go head and jiggle for tha' more more money that's in his hands,
Go head and hit tha' shades with ya thick ass,
Now come over here by the table and give me a lap dance,
Bend it over come and get this dust,
Gota a playa thinkin that be bout to cut,
Gots to hit that from the back,
Shorty gotta' lil' junk in her trunk,
Look at how she make one butt-cheek freeze,
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast,
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move,
Then move both sides then clap that ass,
Remember them times... When you met two shorty's
And you really want the cutie,
But you let her slide... ''cause the other gotta really big ol' donkey booty,
Now shorty think she fine, only if she really knew the truth,
I ain't gone lie, girl twurk them thigh's,
I'm in love with your big badunkadunk,

Can you make it go wobbley-wobbley, come on and follow me,
Take you on a ride on the oddesy and umm...
If you let it jiggley-jiggley, make it go wiggley,
Baby you can never get rid of me and umm...
Twurk something... Oooh yeah...
Yeah that booty softer then a teddy bear,
So phat I can barely stare, with a darier, that's scary there,
Come and drop for a nigga named Twista,
Come and pop for me like a pistol,
Got badunkadunk's from a MOB and got badunkadunk's for Jazze Phizzle,
Girl you deserve respect, you look so good girl I commned you,
The hottest thang on the menu,
When I'm off up in the strip club, I like to get you,
Twurk that thang, bounce that ass,
Work it all the way down to the floor,
Climb to the top, shake it up-side down,
Side of the motherfuckin' floor,
Work that crown, give a lap dance,
Shake it like it's for lady-groups,
Take all the ballers to the V.I.P,

Last night, good kush and sirrock with a super freak
Told him put it on my black card,
Get it super sweet
We can do it right now girl, I don't give a f*ck
Right here in the valley, we can do it in the truck
Got her legs on the dashboard, yeah I got a boulder
Don't know if the kush heat with the
Go, but I'll be back though

Had a couple drinks, later air it was perfect
The enjoying the scene, now breathe
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew, through my hair love
I stunned by your stare
From the sight of you, standing there love
I could walk, walk on air
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw a tourist staring back at me

Pas d'innocents, on a l'goût du sang
J'connais ton destin si t'es pas des nôtres
Kho j'redeviens gamin quand on est 200
Où la mort des uns fait le bonheur des autres
Kho t'as serré une main et t'as pris 2 ans
Ouvre leur la porte, ils nous reste à manger
J'suis dans l'feu d'l'action, j'suis dans l'feu tout court
On revient toujours sur les lieux du danger
Top départ (top départ, top départ)
Donne le go (donne le go)
Ramène mon cheval écuyer
Pourtour rouge sur lui, lunette aiguillée
Frère, pour appuyer, j'attendrais pas juillet
Un automatique pour tirer sous l'eau
Un frérot d'ma clique pour faire le boulot
On t'soulève sans cric
Un magnum qui gifle, qui percute l'ogive, qui sort du rouleau
J'les ai sur les côtes, j'les ai sur les os
J'traîne avec Karim, la balafre quand c'est l'zoo
Il fait l'con, te casse
On repasse le lendemain, 30 secondes montre en main
On remonte le réseau
Un rendez-vous sombre, l'équipe qui s'impose
Un tireur prend la pose, un siste-gro fané
Un Audi qu'arrose, un mort pour la cause
Glisse dans un tacos une liasse cellophanée

Move to the beat, do the 2 step swing
And if you don't dance, f*ck it go bang

Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,

I kinda like Miami, I might lock it down

My girl with me, she cook better than Mr. Chows
Told her I order somethin', baby just dial zero for room service
She looked up and smiled
I was just stuck in the hood

Look at me now
Opened up my safe and put the chain around my neck
Then I locked my watch, bling blaow, pinky ring and bracelet
Kinda loud, I got a lotta jewels, 'cause I got a lotta style

Before I got here, my homie was on trial
Walked in the court, the jurors was like, wow
Hollered at Shaq, they was playin' some clowns
Went to the game, can't blend in with the crowd

Won a couple grand when Shaquille got fouled
Bet you he make these an easy then thou
The best of both worlds is a kilo and a pound
In case I gotta bang I'm totin' the 40 cal

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

What it is? What it was?
Who you wit? Is you wit us?
'Cause we love to bang and swing and live it up
I get low and roll a tree wit a foe

Break bread or fake dead, that's the slogan, li'l homie
Why you da boss? See I been chosin', li'l homie
And I been doin this the old fashioned way
Stickin', movin', on these suckas just like Cassius Clay

Make it rain? Naw boo, I'm tryna stash my cash away
Knockin' down trap doors and turnin' out rap whores
Sellin' out rap tours on your favorite television show
Goin' hard on 'em though

East coast let loose, my nephew, Papoose, he got the juice
So watch the Impala as it swing by and be on the lookout
For them boys with them gang signs, that's us and you can trust
We gon' bust Big Snoop and Papoose bang, bang in your truck

Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

My style similar to hell, hotter than high temperatures
World wide finisher, the US, I'm the lyrical president
The UK king, wild sinister
They love me in Canada, they call me the prime minister

Said I'd lose my life on the corner
But I'm in Miami on the balcony, overlookin' the water
Give my credit card to my daughter
Tell her to swipe it like Swiper from Dora The Explorer

And I just bought her the ice that don't melt
I give her what she want, she spoiled like old milk
They'll say the block slow if you ain't really smart chill
Cop from another connect, give you the raw deal

Flip your money twice then come for some more crills
Dudes will flip on you, the game ill
Since they like flippin' on me man, I cop that long steel
Hit him in his side and make him do a cartwheel

Earlier today a Broward County appellate court judge has
Upheld the previous ruling to ban the sale of Miami rap group 
The 2 Live Crew's double-platinum album, ""Nasty As They Wanna Be,"" in Broward County

We think it's the banning of free speech
First Amendment protects material, presumptively

We don't talk about, uh, harassing and sexually brutalizing women in my music, man!
We don't do that in my music, man, I'm tired of you saying that!

We've got white-collar people trying to grab our style
Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking, thinking we will fall
But they're like flies movin' the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to have, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 Live, too black, too strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y'all, to what we say
We won't be banned in the U-S-A!

If it's an adult show you have to be 18
Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity
There's a lot of people, curiosity is aroused
We're selling records to a totally different audience
I take a precaution that nobody else has
I stickered my album
I made two versions, two versions, two versions

The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin', it didn't include me?
I like to party and have a good time
There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhymes
I know you don't think we'll ever quit
We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do
You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you
This is the 90's and we're comin' on strong
Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong
Wisen up, cause on Election Day
We'll see who's banned in the U-S-A!

And they still arrested us for performing in front of adults!

What is this? Is this not America?
This is not China, this is not Russia!
This is not the place where they brought down the wall
This is America!
We have the right to say what we want to say
We have the right to do what we want to do
And what I do in my house, you might not do in your house
So what I do in my house is my business
And the simple fact of it all is that we are bonded by the First Amendment!
We have the freedom of expression!
We have the freedom of choice!
And you, Chinese, black, green, purple, Jew
You have the right to listen to whoever you want to
And even the 2 Live Crew! (2 Live Crew, 2 Live Crew)

"Sie sagen, dass ich alt wäre und kein'n Hunger mehr hätt'
Und nur noch Alben mach', weil die Vorschuss-Summe so schmeckt
Ich war die Zukunft des Raps, bin jetzt zu unterschätzt
Dummes Geschwätz, ich schieß' Bars in euer Tunten-Ballett
Mich zu battlen ist wie wenn man schlafende Hunde aufweckt
Wie wenn man in 'ne Kreissäge seine Zunge rausstreckt
Wie wenn man sich nackt auf paar Kippen-Stummel draufsetzt
Und danach mit Salzsäure seine Wunden auswäscht
Wettquote wär' so hundert zu sechs
Wenn man auf dich 'n Hunderter setzt, ist 'n Hunderter weg
Meine Eier prophezeien, ich hätt' mit hundert noch Sex
Dabei hatt' ich jetzt schon so viel wie du mit hundert nicht hättst
Und Rapper bieten jetzt für meine Bars paar Hundert in Cash
Weil sie wissen, dass ich davon noch paar Hunderte hätt'
Doch seh' ich für sie schwarz wie Penner-Zähne
Arschkriecher-Style, ihre Köpfe seh'n aus, als würd's Nutella regnen
Ich treff' deine Frau blau auf einer Keller-Fete
Und ihr Treueschwur reißt wie 'ne Patellasehne
Ich verlege mehr Rohre als in 'ner Klempner-Lehre
Rapper reden von Knete und machen Cent-Beträge
Reden von ihren Schlampen, als ob's Rihanna wäre
Wollen jetzt wie Männer reden, reden nur von Männer-Ehre
Okay, nur wenn ich eins nicht versteh'
Dann warum das Wort Hund für 'ne Beleidigung steht
Ein Hund ist treu, er ist grade und zeigt Loyalität
Was schon drei Eigenschaften sind, die euch allen fehlen
Ihr wart gestern mit dem und seid heute mit dem
Heuchler hoch zehn, eure Logik würd' selbst Freud nicht verstehen
Bei euch fängt Beef erst mit Worten an
Danach schreiben die Reporter, dann
Droht ihr euch vor allemann ein Mord an, dann
Gibt’s 'ne Telko zwischen Ali, Can und Orkan, dann
Sitzt ihr im Café und bietet euch 'n Stückchen Torte an
Aber ich bin nicht das Ordnungsamt
Ich klopp' deinen Schädel in Sphären, die die NASA nicht mehr orten kann
Zähne stecken im Hinterkopf deines Vordermanns
Hirnreste laufen an sei'm Ohr entlang, oh, verdammt
Und dein Kadaver macht einen Mordsgestank
Wärst du statt Rappen lieber in Chor gegangen
Hätt' sich dein Esel von Vater nur niemals fortgepflanzt
Wärst du nicht die größte Missgeburt, die in dei'm Dorf entstand
Eure Schlampen kommen blasen jetzt
Deep-throat, bis die Kotze im Kreis fliegt wie im Fahrgeschäft
Ich halt' die Haare fest, halte sie niet- und nagelfest
Nagel' sie aufm Nagelbrett, so lang bis sie ein'n fahren lässt
Nagel' sie in ihres Vaters Bett
Würd' sie beim Nageln spazieren tragen, aber dafür ist ihr Arsch zu fett
Danach setz' ich ab in einem Lazarett
Mit roten Flecken an ihrem Körper, als wenn sie Masern hätt'
Ich weiß, es ist Bares, was zählt
Nur seht ihr aus wie Ladyboys in Maserati-Coupés
Ihr seid keine Rapper mehr, ihr könnt als Schlager durchgehen
Ricky Martin will seinen Swag zurück, asap
Guck mal, ich weiß, was dir Made noch fehlt
'N Gucci-Cap für deinen Hurensohn-Starterpaket
Ich zieh' den Karren ausm Dreck, so wie der ADAC
Und renn' alleine vorne weg, so wie ein schwarzer Athlet
Rapper werden jetzt nervös, wenn sie meinen Namen schon sehen
Haben die Buchse voll, als hätten sie ein Magenproblem
Guck, ich gebe euch ganz klar zu verstehen
Ich bin der King dieser Bars, scheißegal, ob zehn Jahre vergehen
Ich hab' Bars, die wie Fussel aus mei'm Bart rauskommen
Mehr Bars als Kinder zum Sankt Martin kommen
Mehr Bars als Beamte aus'm Rathaus kommen
Mehr Bars als in ganz Jamaika Gras-Aufkommen
Und mehr Bars als Na-na-nas im Arschficksong
Rapper laufen jetzt geduckt wie bei Parkinson
Ich schwör', wenn ich mit diesen Bars rauskomm'
Siehst du Biggies Arm mit 'nem Daumen hoch aus sei'm Grab rauskommen, çüş
Ich bewerfe euch mit Affenkot
Deine Bitch will 'n Spritz ab, so wie Aperol
Du kannst zusehen wie der Mann im Mond
Wie sie zwischen Rappern hin und her gereicht wird wie DJ Khaleds Sohn
Und da es keinen besseren gibt
Wenn es um Punchlines geht, mach' ich ab jetzt nur noch Hits
Mein Sohn fragte, was ich mache, wenn ein Rapper mich disst
Und weiß seit diesen Bars, dass die Frage lächerlich ist
Ich bin zwar nicht so gut mit Autotune
Doch wenn du jemand anders suchst
Der so spitten kann wie ich, mach mal die Augen zu
Richtig, außer Snaga findest du keinen
Vorher findest du 'n Scharfschützen im Blindenverein
Und auch wenn keines meiner Alben es bis heute auf Platz drei geschafft hat
Vergiss nicht, wer euch so zu rappen beigebracht hat

"Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 am
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken' stuper I did what I shoulda' never done
And now I'm sittin' here, talkin' to you, drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

You know I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers til' they get here
Yeah I know the sun is comin' up and ya'll are probably gettin' ready for closin' up
But I'm tryin' to drown my soul I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
And everything that I love is gone and I'm tired of hangin' on

She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park so I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

I guess it was meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I'm headed for the penitentiary
See me on tv
The next cop series I am danger
I guess I shoulda' did somethin' 'bout my anger
But I never learned
Real things that don't concern I pour kerosene on everything
I love to watch it burn
You know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit

And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
And when we all pile out that county van
They're gonna ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
And I'm waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park so I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

Well I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
And I'm waitin' on my ride on the outside
You know I crashed that piece of shit
And then I stepped away
Yeah, I stepped away
You know I crashed that piece of shit
And then I stepped away...",Bartender Song,Rap
"Newscaster: In the news tonight rap star Mack 10 releases his second
solo album titled ""Based On A True Story,"" and according to reliable
sources Ha, he laughs in the face of the sophomore jinx. After the 
release of Westside Connection and Mack's new record, gangster rap
seems to be at an all time high.

Verse 1
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
you either got ends or struggle to make ends meet
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel
some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip
so I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin'
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin'
either death or the pen' shit I had to do better
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar
a young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang
now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes
and I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus <""Story"" sung in background throughout>
You can feel nigga
It's based on a true story
You know it's real nigga
Based on a true story

Verse 2
The year 1986 is when it all started
now eleven years later we still rough and cold hearted
and as the saga continues I ride the wave like a Sea Doo
not to knock hip hop but gangsta rap is what we do
Niggas on they first album
already sold a mil'
So before you knock our style
at least admit that it's real
It's all sex drugs and violence
so you pretend you ain't checkin'
You mean to tell me people
really ain't dyin' every second
Now y'all made the rules
niggas can say what they choose
So if you gone ban Gangsta rap
then you got to ban the news
That means no weather report
no Waco and the bad reverand
No channel 4 channel 7 and no film at eleven
With no high school diplomas we became millionaires
media mad 'cause we winning and we really playin' fair
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus

Verse 3
I crumble green on a magazine
ready to roll a joint
damn in this billboard
I'm number one with a hollow point
It was a rough road ahead
but for my kids I gotta pave it
so I twist one shake the weed out
close the book up and save it
'Cause my son li'l Mack
might grow up and have a crew
and he can show all his homies
this what my daddy used to do
See I was raised around gangstas
and grindas since a youth
so the shit I rap abouts like 99% truth
With dedicated fans from bebe kids
to bambinos and niggas that's CEO's
before they reach they three O's
Maneuver through the corporate world
makin' moves to take ours
Rolling big German luxury and Italian sports cars
so watch what you do 'cause you know we playa hated
and everytime it's a homicide they call it gang related
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus (2X)

Too $hort talking: Say Mack baby, it's yo pa'tna $hort dog man.
You know I got yo back boy. You know a nigga like me I just left
the Ferrarri dealer man. I ain't go lie I know you ridin' rims.
But the problem is, it's a lot of mothafuckas out there that think we
rappers man. That think we just sit at home and make this up at
our momma's house. I hate to tell y'all man some of us are real playas
real ballers biitch.",Based on a True Story,Rap

I like the way they dribble up and down the court,
Just like I'm the King on the microphone, so is Dr. J and Moses Malone,

My favorite play is the alley-oop,
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go,

To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl,
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West,
To play Basketball at it's very best,
Basketball has always been my thing,
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King,
And number 33, my man Kareem,
Is the center on my starting team,

(To the hoop, ya'll, Watch out, Watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete,
Now these players, could never be beat,
Isiah, and Iceman too,
Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too,
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene,
And Ralph Sampson is really mean,
Bill Russell didn't take no junk,
and Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk,
Tell me, were you in the joint?,
The night Wilt scored 100 points,
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back,
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack,
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team,
With moves that came right out of a dream,
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall,
Playing D with desire, it's Basketball,",Basketball,Rap

All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
I'm born to destroy the fallacies, stop creating believers
Start creating the leaders, tell 'em who they should follow
Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
Especially when they empty and death reserves for fulfillment
You the only person alive who holds the key to your healin'
So you take it and you run with it
And keep going even when your suns hidden
Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain comes
Is where we often find the light soon as the pain's done
There ain't material things in the world
That can change the fact that you feel lonely
Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
Take the sun and you still grow, lose the light and you still glow
I been there, I'm still here and I know how you feel, so

Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

We don't wanna fight
So sing with me our battle cry
Sing with me our battle cry
Ooh ooh
Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh

It's hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
A minute in my position filled with my opposition
That anybody not different fighting to stay the same
I got lives in my hands and I'm fighting to make 'em change
Couldn't accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
The emotions that I'm harboring 'bout to drive me insane
Tried to say f*ck everything, but I ain't have the heart to
Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
Inspire life into anybody that's forfeiting
'Cause it's easy to keep pretending that there's nothing wrong
But it's harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
So, now they telling me ""go, Haze, they can't stop you
Heavyweight flow, if they can't lift you then they can't drop you
The pinnacle, if they can't reach you then they can't top you
Man, they can't do anything that you're about to""

Money cannot buy
All the love that's here tonight
All the love that's here tonight
Ooh ooh
There's just you and I
So lift your hands toward the sky
Lift your hands toward the sky
Ooh ooh

We don't wanna fight
So sing with me our battle cry
Sing with me our battle cry

"The wound heals but it never does
That’s cause you’re at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the front line with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armours and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

'Cause you've set me on fire
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah

Hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love

And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does

"Be a father, if not, why bother, son
A boy can make 'em, but a man can raise one
If you did it, admit it and stick with it
Don't say it ain't yours 'cause all women are not whores
Ninety percent represent a woman that is faithful
Ladies, can I hear it? Thank you.
When a girl gets pregnant, her man is gonna run around
Dissin' her for nine months, when it's born he wants to come around
Talking that I'm sorry for what I did
And all of a sudden he wants to see his kid
She had to bear it by herself and take care of it by herself
And givin' her money for milk won't really help
Half of the fathers with sons and daughters don't even want to take 'em
But it's so easy for them to make 'em
It's true, if it weren't for you then the child wouldn't exist
After a skeeze, there's responsibilities so don't resist
Be a father to your child

You see, I hate when a brother makes a child and then denies it
Thinking that money is the answer so he buys it
A whole bunch of gifts and a lot of presents
It's not the presents, it;s your presence and essence
Of being there and showing the baby that you care
Stop sittin' like a chair and having your baby wonder where you are
Or who you are----fool, you are his daddy
Dib;t act like you ain't cause that really makes me mad, G.
To see a mother and a baby suffer
I've had enough of brothers who don't love the
Fact that a baby brings joy into your life
You could still be called daddy if the mother's not your wife
Don't be scared, be prepared 'cause love is gonna getcha
It will always be your child even if she ain't witcha
So don't front on your child when it's your own
'Cause if you front now, then you'll regret it when it's grown
Be a father to your child

Put yourself in his position and see what you're done
But just keep in mind that you're somebody;s son
How would you like it if your father was a stranger
And then tried to come into your life and tried to change
The way your mother raised ya----now, wouldn't that amaze ya?
To be or not to be, that is the question
When you're wrong, you're wrong, it's time to make a correction
Harassin' the mother for being with another man
But if the brother man can do it better than you can,
let him. Don't sweat him, duke
Let him do the job that you couldn't do.
You're claimin you was there, but not when she needed you
And now you want to come around for a day or two?
It's never too late to correct your mistake
So get yourself together for your child's sake
And be a father to your child",Be a Father to Your Child,Rap
"Why do we argue the way we do
Can't you see girl that I, I'm in love with you

To see you cry (to see you sad and blue)

But you feel (you feel someone)
When no one (will take the place of you)
And I don't wanne be alone

No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do

Don't hide the way you feel for me no more (no more)
Just because we're miles away doesn't mean I'm insecure
And it hurts (it hurts so bad)
To hear you cry (when I can't hold you)
And you're needing me the most

Lying around the block

Too many clowns in this spot
No, I don't bump like that
Goes to where I have a beer and a shot of jazz
And after that we can head back to the crib
And I can show you just how bachelors live
But I'm sick of being alone,
Waiting for the phone,
For cutie to call with the bootie call
Rock-a-fella why'all

Don't turn away from my love you will see

Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a f*ck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

And I hope you don't take advantage of it again 
Hold her when she wants to be held 
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you oh
Take her to her favorite place more offer than not 
Don't take her kindness for weakness cause I'm sure she'll love you a lot
Support her in all that she does 
Don't tear her down lift her up 
Cause that is the worse thing you can do to someone you love 
Put her high on a pedestal and tell her when she looks beautiful 
Tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful",Beautiful,Rap

Bought my first Caprice, put fifty in the motor
Bricks they was beautiful, yeah, Mona Lisa
The streets introduced me to money, nice to meet ya
Ray Charles in these Ray Bans, why?
Touched them keys with both hands?
If I die, remember me like Don Killuminati
Bury me on the left, right next to John Gotti

Push your shit back like nail shops do cuticles
Snowman, tell these niggas that we livin' it
Front yard like a soccer field, and we kickin' it
Sick condos, pockets full of Rondos
Choppers wit' extended clips, long as El Segundo
Jeezy like Versace, so we rented out the mansion
Fuckin' European models, skin white as Marilyn Manson
Came a long way from a nigga first advancement
Test drive the new Bugatti, hold that bitch for ransom

Out in LA, I’m with my main bitches
Tiptoein' on marble, got me trippin' on these pain killers

The one with old wood creaking that would burn away right on cue
I try to be not like that but some people really suck
Some people need to get the axing chalk it up to bad luck

She's always running from something so many things ignored
I might do that stuff if it didn't make me feel like shit
I'm on some old reality tip so many trips in it

Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care

"Yo, I'm quite single, and occassionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also, some conversation, companionship, common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just, wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And, I was very content, and you deserved every complement
Now, remember our indifferences make us the same
You gotta have some game, or
You ain't even gonna be able to take care of yourself, uh
And Love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
Shawty, you dead fine, but the bottom-line is
You're still my sister

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

Yeah, I met you and y'all knew, saw you again on Marietta
Downtown Atlanta, checkin your long legs, got me smirkin
Fixed me dinner one night, candles lit
Kinda ahought you was slick in the beginnin
But it teurned out you wouldn't lie
Looked me in my eye, I listened
Sucked it up, pushed on, we made amends, both sides clicked
True friends, since then, years done gon by
Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win
Beautiful black skin

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within

What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

No need to compete, with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale, of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose, her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL

Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin for the OK
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be

I rolls the dice, takin a chance at crappin out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man that's bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin for, like a dreamto my end
I wanted to be more than friends
Beautiful black skin (black skin)

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, first grade, Oak street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading up the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That west side? Becky, Becky, Becky G

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, what you know about the in and out lines?
And what you know about that 4×5 drive?
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood and Vine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home randies
Donuts, so what? Holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain’t no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me roaming in my barrio
I’m with my litas praying the Rosario
Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop till I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the f*ck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the f*ck out, don't yell at me

A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth

When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still dig Van, ya dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voodoo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay?
Where's the 'pink Cadillacs protected by' whoever?
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians want to protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

At the end you may lose nothin but teeth

When they have beef, you might die

While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, f*ck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin

I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right

Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest

Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce

"There's main steam
With the main dreams
But waterfalls start with a little stream
Even Kubrick started with a small scene
Before it became The Shinning
If your coming from the hood
Work on getting Knowledge
If your from the front like you wanna survive
I didn't choose the battles but the battle chose me
When the bullet first hit my cousin Willsie
I been in the game now 5.3
Lil shorty but got shorties after me
I stay humble from the shit I see
Cause I already know there's only one me

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, and we got no juice
I need a believer

There's more means or more mean
Every Tree started with a little bean
And everything you go through at 17
Will it still count at 70?
If I'm coming from the streets
Then I'm getting money
But my ideas in the bank are worth plenty
I didn't choose the music but the music choose me
The art of hitting your speakers making it bleed
I've been thinking about what effects me
And the will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows what I be
And every glass of liquor get me tipsy

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose
And the water ran dry, and we got no juice
I need a believer

It's about people not money
Light up a parliament, turn a car key
I could be a genius, I could be a cheat
It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it
I didn't choose a struggle but a struggle choose me
So I'm dancing on the rubble permanently
I'm cut from the cloth that you made me
When I'm driving down the alley these cats know me
If it's not cook, then we bring heat
If it's got feet then, it's on Neet
Anything on Neet has got that beat

I really would like see the star shine
But I keep getting covered up in hard time
A ooh, I need to let loose

Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long

So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say f*ck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials

"featuring Peter Gunz 

Chorus: Peter Gunz 

I'm sending rappers to heaven 
so call me uplifting 
I greet ya defeat ya 
take all your recognition 
be in the ignition first gear 
I'm gone 
had the best to the worst confess my lyrics is strong 

Verse 1: Shaq  Peter Gunz 

I was born to raise hell and cause havoc when I enter 
have the pin back hands up white flag surrender 
what I'm into pulling stocks and bonds and cheddar 
gauaranteeing the world you can't find nuthin better 
so whatever 
bring it the front and put your money by your mouth 
find your teeth and cash coming out 
I bring drama to your momma if she want it 
you think I'm fronitin' a fruad 
Peter tell 'em how I want it 

aiyo Shaq the world is yours 
but can I get a city 
gritty blocks shitty cops 
broads with tingo bittys 
hit 50 in the ruckus mutha 
is I happy 
you callin me fraud but your broad's calling me daddy 
while you pumpin dollar bottles on the floor looking funny 
I'm going drop hits with Shaq kid 
and dirt getting money 
sunney days is made the pain it rains no more 
the cash will last from now the guns hits the floor 

Chorus 

Verse 2: Shaq 

check it 
Enrico dope like perscriptions from pharmacys 
injecting through speakers with no limit slash no mercy 
the ill beat seaker 
I mystify minds like I'm a preacher 
when I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure 
you best believe I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve 
expidisouly I get loose like hair weave 
which mc out there want to come test me 
put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me 
I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs 
I change my name to Deon cause I'm mutha freaking prime time 

Chorus 

Verse 3: Peter Gunz 

out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter 
the melon a felon under the first name Peter 
looking out the hour glass what do I see 
Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty 
I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left 
young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death 
my breath and oxygen is limited 
they did me in with it 
they took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it 
I live alive to see my seed breath airs 
in and exhale but please breath clean air 
runnin 'round killin people with sex you flex 
spread in the bed ask me dread who's next

Shear shirts by Chanel, baby, feel the breeze 
Drop top, me and shorty, while she be at my knees 
Let the wind blow, low fade, peep the glow 
Know my style from the foul days, keep it low 
Got new plans, worldwide, livin the life 
Any chick I make wife gon' shiver tonight 
Know the game, it's ups and downs learnin the ropes 
26 years of age, just learnin to cope 
Came a long way but still got so far to go 
So by now, I guess you know, talk to me

What if we all had minds alike? Thought the same 
Only few was taught to get this, divorce the game 
Visualized as a young cat, saw the dream 
Get large, shit hard, and assorted CREAM 
So many came that I saw and went wise on my ways 
Made livin for me more intense, divided my days 
Weekends, party nights, raffled the stakes 
Love sophisticated women, those that rather you wait 
Tipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof 
Rocked it all, from designer suits to climbin boots 
All in the summertime, workin the courts 
Lookin mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin them shorts 
So many ladies in the world today searchin for mates 
Got these non-players perpin for dates, hold up 
Give me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia 
Hot enough for me to slide this up in ya

So behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme 
Move accordin like the Chosen Ones roamin the Earth 
Gettin head until I'm dead, decompose in the dirt 
Play the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all 
Rollin dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball 
Havin fun at the main event, toastin cups 
Quarter pieces tryin to get yours roastin up 
Play the game if you got toys to match your words 
You a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds 
Only a few left, still sincere, spread love

"Ladies and gentlemen it's boosie boo king of Louisana
I been the truth if you don't know betta ask somebody
I am the show and the after party I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no more still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home gotta get it on late nights
To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

She roller coaster ride me in the projects
Where ya find I got the whole hood behind
Me my records selling out the stores
Now my money on 4s now you best believe it
They feeling me from Alaska to Tennessee
From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang
I spit I really mean that shit it's crazy
Ain't it hard to explain it I done got famous
All I did was brang it savage life behind the mic now
Everybody hollerin' bout trill entertainment rest in peace
Pimp C I scream that shit every time I do shows you put me on
And I ain't forget so for my nigga
I gotta f*ck 2 hoes whateva y'all mean I ain't got cream
You see me in the hood don't thank I can't leave
When I was 19 already and deal y'all other lil' niggas
Y'all jus' selling y'all dreams I ain't through yet
I done done it all got a lot of stuff I been through yet
I fucked up I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gon' make it
Through that from Miami to L.A. back to Manhattan
Where the big cake from Baton Rouge I done did it gon' ahead admit it
I'ma the shit hey and ion care what a bitch say

And I ain't puttin' no rims on it

"Uptight, every thing is all right
Outta sight, it's all right

Pay at the end of the day

Thanks that me don't have to grumble
Goodness is coming our way
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right

I do remember, I do recall
The magic moments when we stood so tall
A nation to be respected, a nation full of pride
So shake the bluesy feeling that is hurting you inside
Hurting you inside

There's better days ahead for us
You need not fret nor worry
Oh yes, this time around, my friend
I'm sure you won't be sorry

They say how the future
Is guided by your past
Through trials and tribulation
Yes, we were meant to last

So hold on to your hope and dreams
For all that it's worth
'Cause I know the day will come
When the meek shall inherit the world

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you uptight, everything's all right
Outta sight, it's all right
They'll be better days, don't you worry
A positive way you won't be sorry

Better days, heyy! Better days
Got me thinkin' bout better days
Better days! Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' bout better days

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
Wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days, hey!
Better days, got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
That in my future years, I'd be stressin'
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin'
Lookin for them better days

(Lookin' for better)
Better days, better days hey!
Better days (Oh better days) 
Thinkin' bout better days (I'm lookin for better)
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days (Better days)
Got me thinkin bout better days (Oh)

Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days

(Lookin' for better)
Better days, better days, hey!
(Better days) Thinkin' bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days

I send this one out, 
To all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, 
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island,

All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin' homeboy, keep your head up

She wants to be that one to give me that love you ain't ready for
You better start talking, girl

I go to the club strictly to party and find something to twork with
I'm the dude that all the girls wanna flirt with
Jump up in the booth show me just how they work it
So shortly your window is small to work with
I see it in your eyes but you ain't saying nothing
Your girl doing everything trying to push my buttons
Symbolizing us leaving and me cutting
Easy like Tiga' on the green when he puttin'
You betta' start talking
Shorty wanna do something
Do something too live crew man man
Shorty wanna move something
And you front like it ain't what it is
Bout to lose all this 'cause you ain't handle yo bizz
After two shots of the three
She was all on me
And you seen it but try to play it like a PIMP
Now I respect that
But sometimes that's a set back
And I really can't see you setting back lettin' that
Be the reason we ain't breezin' through the city

Can't you see she wants to (take your place)

"Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby
Bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst

Jetzt ist es wohl soweit, 
Du wirst nie mehr wiederkehren
Glaub mir, es tut sehr vielen leid
All denen, die dich so verehren
Deine Ketten sind verschweißt
Keiner wird dich wiedersehen
Jetzt wo du für immer verreist, 
Werd' ich noch mal zu dir gehen

Uh oh

Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby
Bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst

Damit musstest du rechnen, nicht nur ich hab es geahnt
Denn du hast nicht den deinen Taten entsprechenden Weg für dich gebahnt
Wie doch alle an dich glaubten, alle strömten zu dir
Die, die so viele beraubten, teilten mit dir ihre Gier
Herr, lass mich auch mit denen streiten
Die ihr ewigen Ruhm prophezeiten 
Denn sie logen und phantasierten für die, die mit ihr die Welt regierten

Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, 
Bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst

Jetzt steht bald keiner mehr für dich ein
Du bist Tag und Nacht allein
Es kann nur noch wenig, sehr wenig Leben in dir sein
Die Verkäufer und die Käufer deiner Waren
Sieh sie dir an denn jetzt fliehen sie in Scharen
Sie sind ihres klaren Verstandes beraubt
Denn sie hatten mit der Sicherheit des Todes so fest an dich geglaubt

Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby
Bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst

Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby,

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying f*ck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart

Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
F*ck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, f*ck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone dies
Then she text me like ""Why you still talk to my mama?""
How the f*ck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, f*ck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me the one I f*ck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped pad sch--
But players f*ck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

"Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit""
Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit""
He said, ""Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen""
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Pretty nigga, let him be f*ck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a f*ck about it
Quick to round up on that Audi, make em get the f*ck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my clip before that five go bang
Bang bang, guap time, rep game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak
Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect",Big Beast,Rap

Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking

Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanny, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up 
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's got head up
Wall to wall y'all all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker tryin to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was goin gold
While I was on tour, you was tourin the hoe stroll
Suckin dicks and turnin tricks to get a quick fix
While I was puttin dope hits in the mix
Rippin shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fuckin up Roxanne and takin out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks 
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Striclty big names on the topic read mine
The q-you-double e-n
Queen of emceein
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the f*ck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

	(Mama - mama - Aww!)
	(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Recitin poems that hit like boulders
Smackin your head dead off your muthafuckin shoulders
So nip all the talk in a bud
This ain't no Game Boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinkin that she can last with me 
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'ma start callin off names
First up there's Latifah
You roll up, and I'ma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the f*ck out tryin to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phoney
Try to get flippid, I'ma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breakin your neck tryin to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the f*ck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanny's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, f*ck around, lay around, hoe 
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

	(Mama - mama - Aww!)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marihuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sendin you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'ma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a wush don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop actin like a man
She needs somethin real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a patted butt
Instead of stompin to the 90s, use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack Lelane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the fryin pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fuckin gumbut to your gut
I'm bringin tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for 10 years
Bring any hoe, and I wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, hoe 
While I get dough, you're givin up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm makin it clear
Kickin flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other MC's comin close to me
I leave em all in the dust
>From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust

"I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake
Playin' the wall, takin' a break
Admirin' the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodies built to swing
That's when I seen her
Her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said, ""How you doin', my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm livin' kind of foul
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl""
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her
Layin' like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happenin'
She had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty
I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin

Tina got a big ole butt

To try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'
Cold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her
Her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only seventeen but, yo, don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire""
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I have her a hug
I said to the girl, ""them young boys ain't nothin'
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button""
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eatin'
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheatin', but

I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car
Somebody shouted out, ""I don't care who you are""
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin'
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" I said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza
What's your name?"" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back""
She looked at me and said, ""Make yourself clear
L, where we going?"" I said, ""Right here""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And have her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break 'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is born
I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol

Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' slab
Livin' ghetto fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track 
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool

All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody want to ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't f*ck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin' baby, I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Chromin' shinin' sippin' daily, no rest until whitey pay me

"Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto', so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven, eight, nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food, then go the hell out
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah, and I'm feelin alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog don't blame me

Now do I love them hoes? (HELL NAW!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg!)
(And you never gave a f*ck about a bitch;
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha hah, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin like a motherfucker tryin to find a hoe
Hittin all the spots but I'm comin up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin, wishin
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
But she caviar, and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

I have pimped my pen, on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me, when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip, smell, or run
As she turned the trick pages, from looseleaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill, for her
I love her that's why she keeps, performing for me
I have pimped my pen, and she is number one, in my stable
Pleasure, is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe, dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked, from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their f*ck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked, ALL day long
A tangy, little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday... to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them, like la-di-da-di
I rock them, mighty hardy, like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body",Big Pimpin',Rap

Wise crackin' felines, uh. 
Can a nigga make a bee-line
To that nappy area?  Don't want to marry ya;
Just want to bury ya head in a pillow.
Sorry, but I got a kill yo' pussy-willow.
Janked ass penicillin; ain't got ta ask how ya feelin';
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin'.
Ya want to know how we keep these hos in check? 
Keep them broke, and keep their panties soakin' wet.
I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash.
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass.  (Fat ass.) 
Big thangs on my mind; ain't trippin' at all.
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers;
I feel like a giant sometimes; bitch, don't stare,
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin' ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin'.
Call a tech; blow the whistle; throw the bitch out the game.

Now how can I let this bitch run it,
When her ass ain't never felt the seats of a six hunnit?  (Now.) 
Tricks, we take shits at the rents; we don't get excited 
Over long hair and big tits.
$hort Dawg, they get hella weak when I tell the freak 
We the richest niggas that you gonna ever meet.
We got bosses in the back, countin' the stack.
We got cunts in the front, with Hennesey and blunts.
Now what you want? 
She want to get fucked all night long; bitch, what's up? 
You know I got a tight song;
Heard me on the radio; I can't go wrong.
But you ain't got no features; this can't go on.
You're like a bundle of joy, but you're unemployed.
You ain't throwin', so the pussy is just null and void.
Do you really understand what I'm tellin' you?
Looks can be deceiving, and bitch, I ain't even feelin' you.

[Chorus x 2]

Best believe me; it ain't easy, to be off the heazee.

You can try and figure out the new shit we on.
Before you break yourself make yourself at home.
Give thanks, when it's Ice Cube, $hort Dawg, and Ant Banks.
We all platinum; now ya got ta add francs
To the salary; that'll be cash or charge.
So large; got a whole floor actin' mirage.
We like big thangs; we like runnin' big trains
Of big beautiful bitches with big brains.
Bitches with big brains; I went to Spelman College
To see if my dick could get some higher knowledge.
But pussy is pussy, from Bel-Air to the projects;
Bitch better suck my dick.
Ain't nothin' new; the game is old.
You think the bitch is decent, and that's the same old ho;
Used to f*ck the whole crew; we was ballin', man.
Westside!  You know we doin' big thangs.

You hangin high, you dusted puffin sink lye
My friends are rich, go tell the Feds when you snitch
You fakin moves, with artificial Gotti rules
I'm water repellant, you bounced off my two sacks
My money's in walls, stashed in the mouse cracks
Critics criteria, jealous of my silk interior
I'm big time, with rubber bands built around your mind
My credit is filled in my house packed with ten children
I'm big time
That's right yeah, as I move on, we gotta do this

Got mansions with whore stages, paid my workers minimum wages
I'm known for takin a hundred grand, and bustin 'em down in Vegas
I'm the greatest, high rollin player in the industry
My personal bank account, is United States treasury
Fool that'll be, known to any friend or any foe

Get those hizzes off your mizzind, business is yo' design
Impact wit yo' mack, cause you gotta make it big time

I'm not impressed, no quality there, what's on your brain?
You was caught at my table, drinkin cheap champagne
At the fanciest restaurant, your pockets had no cash
At the drop of a dime, I pulled a hundred out my ass
Then fed your stomach, you loved it, your girl slurped it
Drunk my brew, you started rappin soundin doo-doo
You got real personal, asked if we make a million
I fronted two rocks, and gave the monkies two billion
Look at me, my watch, your girl felt my peepee
You know why? I'm big time

Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar

Rocks in the link
In the drop with a mink

Like my shit don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action

I'm in the fast lane passin'
Breakin' you down like fractions
While we be rappin' about things that really happen

Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
With mademouselle from gezals to versace
With a sweet smell
This female leadin' the posse

Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill

Is it a mans thing for real
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal

Well now it's lookin' like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick
For real

Big Will household name
Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matchin' gators
Swervin' lane

In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew lookin' clean

Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me

Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P.
Eating grapes under the A.C.

"As Arsenio Hall would say, things that make you go HMMMM
The enemy forces inside, approached a young warrior king
and tried to subdue him, but he fought back VAL-iant-ly
The warrior king had emerged from his fighter
and had spoken to one of his subjects
When he returned, the invaders tried to CUT HIM DOWN

Nah! None of that man! No! Uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, none of that no
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uhh

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin'
It ain't, nothin' but the soundboys brawlin'
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin'
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they fall

Mr. Big Bad Mouth Man don't know when to stay quiet
Always talkin bout how he can't be beat, but I don't buy it
Come try it! No one man is a riot, seek the head and fly it
Man against a giant, David against Goliath, I shall triumph
Hold down the fort, hold ground with a fo'-pound
Pronoun in case it go down, cause people are just so low down
At the showdown, the faster he go the harder it is to slow down
Is it my town or yo' town? Can't nobody hold me down
The, BIGGER THEY COME, but soon they won't make a sound
Snatch 'em up and take 'em down, shake the foundation mound
And that's that - now how would you react?
KABOOM out yo' back, it's no mo' movin back
It ain't no get back when the hammer kick back
When the warriors go out to war they seldom make it back
Back backed up against a wall, let's see who got the balls
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they, fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin'
It ain't, nothin' but the soundboys brawlin'
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin'
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they fall

All I want to know is why your man got so much ego
Tough guy, want to pick a fight with me and my a-migos
But he knows, not what him take on is lethal
I'm everyday people, you want me superhero
Big as a redwood, or small as a bonsai
I'm a fungi/fun-guy, but anyway come test me, gon' die
No I'm not gun shy, more like a ninja
Get it when you least expect it
Hit him in the vital pressure points that injure
But I'm really not violent, I meditate in silence
But I was taught, give 'em physical justice if they whylin
Defend yo'self at all times, protect yo'self at all times
Respect yo'self at all times
It's self-preservation versus brutal mankind
Got, nothin to prove, I know mountains don't move
And Bigfoot don't tippy toe
That don't mean it won't get you though
Your ritual, walk around invincible, you imbecile!
Power is habitual, this you know is principal
To overtake the meek is irresistible and sensible
If conscience is invisible, and courage is so minimal
And then I go at 'em all, with unviersal laws
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin'
It ain't, nothin' but the soundboys brawlin'
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin'
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they fall

Now any bad boy can be destroyed and anybody can get hit
Even if you hard, harder than, hard can get
You think you'll never be defeated not even a little bit
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
I mean you too big, too bad, ""2 Legit 2 Quit""
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
You, try on a bad face, OH WHAT A PERFECT FIT
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get

Yo, yo yo - check it out
Yo back in the elementary school had a fight with the king of the class
I wasn't in the mood for getting beat up so I had to kick his ass!
I'm sick of bein bashed, lick a shot and lick it fast
Sooner or later the Gods and the Devils have to clash
Braveheart, gave his heart so he could save his country
Me I want to save the art to start before they hunt me
Whatcha momma taught you HUH? Whatcha momma teach you (HUH?)
Don't know why I fought you, don't know why I beat you
STAND UP to the systematic automatic controller
Robotic, hypnotic, great psychotic ruler
Never give an easy win and NEVER take a draw for..

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin

"In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch damals, als ich jung und wild war im Block
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf
In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch, als wir das erste Mal gechillt haben im Loft
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf

Es war einmal vor langer langer Zeit
Vor 32 Jahren, als Mama schwanger war, sie schreit, denn ich komme!
Ich war so süß ohne die Haare am Sack
Aber die wachsen schon noch, warte mal ab
Ich bin im Osten aufgewachsen, bis ich 9 war
Orangenes Licht und graue Häuser, dann der Aufbruch ins Neuland
An der Entscheidung kann ich nicht nur Gutes lassen
Denn es war nicht immer einfach für uns drei hier Fuß zu fassen
Aber alles hat sich eben so ergeben und mein Vater,
Über den will ich nicht reden, Ich erwarte nichts mehr
Ich wollte keinem glauben, traute nur ein paar Gesichtern
Nachts draußen, die Augen kannten nur Straßenlichter
Konserviert und archiviert, ich hab's gespeichert
Paraphiert und nummeriert, damit ich's leicht hab
Wenn die Erinnerung auch langsam verschwindet
Weiß ich immerhin genau, wo man sie findet

Ich weiß noch damals, als ich jung und wild war im Block
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf
In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch, als wir das erste Mal gechillt haben im Loft
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf

Damals auf'm Hof mit Bobby und so
Dieses Rap-Ding unser neues Hobby und so
Und dieses Gras-Ding 2 Gramm auf Kommi und so
Wir haben geträumt, wir wären ein Promi und so
Ich zog' die Jordans mit den Löchern an und dann 'ne Runde Basketball
In der Raucherecke stand Jamal am Marterpfahl
Ob wir Spaß hatten damals, rate mal
Aber die Schulwand haben wir nicht nur zum Spaß bemalt
Uni passte nicht in meine Welt, nicht mal ein halbes Semester
Wir brauchten Geld, wir waren Rebellen, wir wussten alles besser
Wir haben rumgehangen und Mucke gemacht
Das Mikrofon im Kleiderschrank, wir haben gewusst, dass es klappt
Und jetzt ist es konserviert und archiviert, ich hab's gespeichert
Paraphiert und nummeriert, damit ich's leicht hab
Wenn die Erinnerung auch langsam verschwindet
Weiß ich immerhin genau, wo man sie findet

In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch damals, als ich jung und wild war im Block
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf
In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch, als wir das erste Mal gechillt haben im Loft
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf

In meinem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit dem silbernen Knopf
Sind viele Bilder von 'nem Typ mit 'nem silbernen Kopf
Und viele Bilder von guten Freunden und Freunden die Feinde wurden
Von Autos mit 1000 PS und Bräuten mit geilen Kurven
Von Partys, von Konzerten, von den Brüchen, von den Ärzten
Von den Zeugnissen, dem letzten bis zum ersten
Ich hab Bilder von den Feiertagen, Bilder von mei'm Opa
Ich war so verdammt traurig, als er tot war
Doch ich hab es konserviert und archiviert, ich hab's gespeichert
Paraphiert und nummeriert, damit ich‘s leicht hab
Denn ich weiß genau, bei mir läuft’s nicht für immer rund
Doch was mir bleibt, ist die Erinnerung

In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch damals, als ich jung und wild war im Block
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf
In einem schwarzen Fotoalbum mit 'nem silbernen Knopf
Bewahr' ich alle diese Bilder im Kopf
Ich weiß noch, als wir das erste Mal gechillt haben im Loft
Ich bewahr' mir diese Bilder im Kopf

Niggas want to kidnap, leave me in the trunk
Walk away with big stacks

Glitz and the fame, my cocaine mortgage

In the game like Tony Parker
Snow white range and my partner pocket
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem
Homie, I put that on my only mamma

Still rollin' with the 4, 5th, now that I'm rich
Got these broke niggas so sick
And my daughters college pre-paid, she straight
Say thanks to the D game

Ridin' through the ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot

ID's, passports, it was so sweet
Front yard still a car show, blue gotti to gotti, I'm a rocko
I won't let the roof up, kingdom come, princess Amunda

To be loved, to be loved, oh, what a feeling for me to be loved

Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit
So it's music to my ears every time I feel a clip
I'm a card shark up in a hard rock
Twenty grand a hand, baby, jamin' the ipod

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie

I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
'Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biological
Didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but your not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad

So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from York to Jersey City
Women and child alone now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa

Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall

She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal

She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it

He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
'Cause my biological didn't bother

[Chorus: x4] 
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father 
'Cause my biological didn't bother. (4x)

January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort mamth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go

Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him

Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't 'Gone with the Wind' like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop

Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad

But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard

Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left

I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it

'Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Chorus]

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if your making big dope be materialistic
'Cause you'll end up another statistic

Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I won the ring like hakeem
Uh oh what do you know

Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me

He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
'Cause my biological didn't bother

(Chorus)",Biological Didn't Bother,Rap
"""Lock shit down""  Raekwon 

Verse 1: 
Six million is what it cost them 
To put back together that cat Steve Austin 
Now Defari gets Bionic 
Over 6 million tracks with 10 million topics 
I'm fiber optic crystal clear with my projection 
Wack MCs get cloths lined when they walk across my intersection 
They need protection 
Some guidance some right direction 
A job center with with an application for a new profession 
Never settle for nothing' less 
I blaze contests 
And set shops for pay days 
In strange ways life twists and turn 
Word to Gangstarr in this business skrilla Hard To Earn 
I format attack new knack technique 
Speak with a passion on wax and tape and CD 
Mad niggas front for paper 
And switch like a bitch in and out like a cross fader 
All I know is how to rock shit 
They say the hotter the MC the hotter the spot get 
""Lock shit down"" 

Hook: 
It's the coming 
Of the bionic 
Defari here to 
""Lock shit down"" (x3) 

Verse 2: 
See I got books of lyrics on deck like Tash 
Pocket full of cash ready to bounce rollin' slash 
Seater and hash 
Pro Tour in the Masters 
Grab the mic flex my wrists and hit like Sampres 
Handle this 
Make you believe like an evangelist (what?) 
That real MCs are coming to reclaim Los Angeles 
And here's are standing chance 
To finally get my time to shine 
In the golden state like Sprewell out the hatch 
""Lock lock"" 
This heat is hot it make me lock like astronaut 
Like Heru said that shit for my people when we blow spots 
Pause 
Freeze 
My steez rolls like Es, V12s, trees and seven seas 
If you didn't know champ 
Defari Heru is a Lowland brother 
From the Likwit camp 

Hook 

Verse 3: 
Wack MCs get damaged like civil eyes to savage 
Sharp lyrics cut deep wounds these niggas need bandages 
They can't handle this Los Angeles 
Relentless pressure 
Full court measure for measure 
I'm like Piteno a game plan Gambino 
Where every verse starts with defense first like a casino 
Every minute every hour I use brain power 
For Mr. Space Shuttle Challenger I devour 
A Tower like Eiffel 
Bust off verses like rifles 
Bust all bullets through flesh unless you're wearing a vest 
And even then I still enter 
The human form of a splinter 
The summer fall spring winter 
""Lock lock""

Champion contender 
Holy like the month of December 
The raw prototype member

"Lets do this man for real

We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, re endorsed yards
Everybody four stars, ray like forty jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
F*ck around a hundred texts
Flash flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buzz ain't only in it only for the tokens
Cause they say if who you joking with, chokin' potent with
Tag team the joker chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus

"Hör nicht auf, für das zu leben an was du glaubst
Glaub an dich und schöpfe Vertrauen und Kraft aus deiner Familie,
Die Nacht für Nacht deine Seele bewacht und dich liebt
Ganz egal was du tust, was geschieht, die dich wie eine Hülle umgibt
Wenn du dieses Glück hast hast du fast gesiegt, fast gesiegt
Manches Leben läuft schnell, es ist nicht immer hell
Es ist schwer was zu sehen und im Dunkeln zu gehen
Doch sei dir bewusst, deine Vorfahren hatten schwerste Wege
Und wenn dein Herz noch für sie schlägt dann weißt du genau,
Dass ihr Blut durch dich fliehst, es macht dich sogar schlau durch
Talente die du kriegst, die sich dein Clan vielleicht vor 300 Jahren
Durch schwere Arbeit hart erwarb
Auf was du jetzt zurückgreifen kannst
Zurück in der Zeit, back in time
Du verfügst über Wissen von mehr als 10.000 Jahren
Frag deine Ahnen, deine Vorfahren
Sie heißen Vorfahren obwohl du vor fährst
Sie können nur ahnen wo du sie hinfährst
Hast du den Plan oder bist du verkehrt?
Dann kehre in dich, lass dich gehen
Du musst deine Seele von innen sehen.
Du musst die Familiengruft bei Tag begehen
Obwohl du nicht tot bist frag ich dich

Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?
Kannst du die alten Lieder singen, die tief in deiner Seele liegen
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!
Das ganze Volk soll sie singen.
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!

Wenn eins deine Sinne verwischt weil der wärmste und hellste Stern am Himmel erlischt
Du den Mut und all die Zuversicht verlierst
Und spürst, dass irgendwas in dir zerbricht
Dann hör auf die Stimme die spricht,
Hinder' sie nicht, denn sie weiß wie sie geht
Und zeigt dir den Weg zurück nach Haus du kennst ihn auch
Erinnere dich an das was du längst weißt, und was eigentlich keine frage ist
Du bist nicht schwach, du weißt wie stark du bist
Also ruf, das wach was eingeschlafen ist
Das Leben ist schwer zu durchschauen und fühlt sich unreal an, so als wäre es ein Traum
Und man weiß nicht wirklich, wer Freund oder Feind ist und es fällt schwer zu vertrauen
Aber mach dir bewusst, dass du all diesem Frust vielleicht noch sehr lang standhalten musst
Du brauchst ein starkes Herz, aber kein hartes, sonst wird es kalt in der Brust
Eins haben Feiglinge nie erkannt: Man kann wachsen am steigenden Widerstand
Also sei wie ein Krieger, Mann, nimm wieder am Leben teil und peil deine Ziele an
Denn auch wenn deine Umstände widrig sind kannst du Pläne zu schmieden beginnen
Egal wie groß die Risiken sind, all dein Einsatz wird sich lohnen, denn es gibt viel zu gewinnen
Du spürst das tief in dir drin, wenn die Melodien dieser Lieder erklingen,
Deine Seele umarmen und die Tränen der Wahrheit zu fließen beginnen siehst du den Sinn

Ob alt oder jung, ob blind ob stumm, die ohne Zeit oder die mit Geduld
Sieh dich an, schau dich um, auch du bist ein Mensch aus Fleisch und Blut
Aber auch wie das Küken aus der frischen Brut, spürt er wie der Krieg uns nicht gut tut
Eine ganze Generation schöpft Mut, die ganze Generation einer Nation
Setzt sich den Frieden wie auf einen Thron, die ihr den Krieg liebt, was wisst ihr schon?
Ihr liebt eure Kinder nicht wie Tochter und Sohn, Liebt eure Kinder wie Korn, Rind und Huhn
Ich sag dir Liebe hat damit nichts zu tun, wer den Krieg liebt erntet von mir Hohn
Lautes Gelächter und lauteres drohen, in Form von Liedern, die Herzen durchbohren
Mögen die in der Hölle schmoren, die Selbstmordattentäter auserkoren
Um ihre Drecksarbeit zu tun, mögen sie nie in Frieden ruhen.

Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?

Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt, it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes

You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box

"Everything used to be so good then
Now it seems like you're mad at my footprints
I'm only trying to scribble in the book, man
It's not my fault that y'all couldn't
You must have a lot of free time
Otherwise why are you trying to see mine
Strain your neck, let the blame project
But don't give yourself the same respect
So independent but undependable
We're all getting old, now take a mental note
And stop being so covetous
The crime is the punishment
Now run and get a slither of dignity
You ain't gotta be a figure of misery
You don't want to be a victim to victory
Listening to a bitter sweet symphony

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

We used to get up in Uptown
Then we hit the highway to run around
Came home everybody wanna judge now
Don't let them see you celebrate your touchdown
Keep clutching those grudges
Don't budge if no budget
The old puppets show love in public
But behind the back can't trust it
Disgusted, repugnant
Insulted, repulsive
Discouraged, rejection
No protection from your own reflection
Chip on your shoulder big as a boulder
Insecurities a slippery slope
Got ya looking around for the sympathy vote
Anything to give a little glimmer of hope

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

Treat love like a limited resource
Fight for it like there's never gonna be more
On the rooftops talk to the spaceships
Like you've got 2Pac locked in the basement
Get the bag, make the get away exit
You get mad like your middle name desperate
No net, better not get left back
Yeah, you should probably protect that
I'm trying to keep it simple, teeth to the nipple
Beat my chisel, leave my initials
Fly so far when you follow the signals
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful
Not only are we bitter but we're brittle
The world's getting small, and everybody's little
Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle
Don't ever stop waiting for the window

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

Let me live deep in your mind, I'll put you first all the time
It's all up to you, I'll show you love you've never knew

And ya hit pretty hard in the city of frauds
But uplift the mind and I heal ya scars

My self-esteem, my ninety-eight blade hit 'em

The underdog stranger, super freak hot blast
The hard drop rip is a hostile swing
Kiss my Redemption with a fist full of sting
Swift with the gifts, it's the God Body Squad
It's not a myth, we defy all laws
Now, reach for the stars, now top to the limit
But, all in the all be grateful to be livin
While we work the muscle, we meditate the hustle
Serious the world, experience this struggle
The razor voice, flavor choice steam, redeem
We feelin' calmly now to dominate the scene
The grass more green, attack speed dem (on)
The cliffhanger vaccine, man in machine
Now from round one, mayor style sum
I won't stop the war till y'all drown in my drum

Now, it's up from the Hell with the olive oil voice
Now hurry my hurt, bury dirt deep within

Grant me a beast, stamp kill me with the jury
When I tone a capell, Hell has beauty
A force has awakened, breath-taking vengeance
Midnight power plant, seekin the menace
My wrestling vest, lyric fresh, dry bone
My appetite destruction is official cyclones

One shot fill, bigger homes, bigger stones
It's on now!!!

They're not important.

You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always f*ck him like I'm sorry
Who the f*ck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her

And my cake is triple decker

You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said ""Oooh shit!""
Picked up my phone cause I had to call ""Bullshit!""
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche, hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin' all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack

Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid 
Dipped everyday my style is po lit' 
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost 
I'm headed to the club tonight  we need toast 
For that wack ass MC  talkin' all the shit 
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split 
It's war with the Gods this year, represent 
The bitch-ass niggaz keep tryin' to repent 
But we still lickin' off, we wild like two cent 
Park Hill Projects, say it witcha lungs 
F*ck y'all cats, we always got guns 
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive 
We gotta f*ck somethin' up, dead or alive 
Y'all comin with us, we live on the other side 
Of the chart, where your mother met Poppa Wu

After the tour I came back for more 
Comin' correctly, just like before 
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate 
In the rec room regulatin' with Osirus 
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts 
Minds on lease like expensive imports 
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed 
Livin' life long time may continue to breed 
Never gettin' caught up inside the agencies 
For ten long years, but I paid my fee 
Now I'm on the front line with W.T.C. 
Back me down these streets are still ill 
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill 
Pack with the beef cause niggaz won't chill 
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill 
I'm takin' this shit way back to Bill Bill 
In the projects where my man got killed

Used to be a little stressed now I'm gettin' it right 
Fresh kicks with the gold watch dipped in ice 
From Shaolin, it's the vainglorious man 
When the world go around these things start to happen 
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitchin' 
Bloods accumulatin', we gettin' impatient 
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understandin' 
That's how I'm plannin', blow up like a cannon 
Pull my man in, hit y'all again 
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent 
Build with intelligence break your defense 
No hesitation, time gets spent 
Some fall victim, others get bent 
Some recognize, real niggaz represent 
I can't never stop til my heart is content 
Puttin' in the work til I feel confidant

"J'allais entamer la cinquième manche avec ma bitche 
Quand mars keuss apparaissent dans ma tv 
Ce qui signifie que l'heure est grave, magnifique ce temps 
Baby tiens les draps chauds je reviens et on va à la plage 
J’ai mis mon masque, ma casquette et ma cape, 
Sur ma desperado moto quelle chance je capte 
C'est mars vl'a le message 

Le rap français s'est fait kidnapper 
Par des mauvaises chansons 
Un euro, personne ne paye la rançon 
On cherche un héros prévenu 
Ce coup-là y'a pas de tunes , 
T'inquiètes j'ai l'habitude, mon instru chargé toujours prêt, 
D'après toi qui appelle-t-on lorsque le monde court à sa perte musicale 
Le B et D brodés sur le torse en lettres capitales 
Ne veut pas dire bande d'enfoirés, le mic au poignet 
Si tu ignores qui va gagner, vas te soigner

Au secours on m'appelle 
J'accours au galop 
Black desperahh 
Règle tout hors caméra 
Depuis l’Opera Puccino 
Opère en scred 
Black desperado 
Au secours on m'appelle 
J'accours au galop 
Black desperahh 
Situation à haute température 

J'rapplique rapido si ta go on capture 

Quelques jours d’enquêtes et dix fois que je passe là 
Suspect ce type et, si j’étais susceptible, 
J’aurais pensé que m’etaient destinées ces injures misogynes quand il rugit cria 
Sale karateka de black desperado, on aura ta peau, fallait rester sur ta moto 
Il dit que le rap français est ligoté derrière la porte 
Et que si je voulais y aller fallait passer par son corps 
L'idiot se met en garde prononce un jeu de langue, 
Sens que ça va barder jsuis trop speed, 
J'esquive sa gauche en finesse, 
En traître j'dégaine un lance roquettes 
Un mama lova dans les côtes 
Je l'attrape par le cou, je le montre à ses messieurs 
Ces messieurs me disent trempez le dans l'huile 
Quand j'entends non!!! Pitié tiens la clé 
Juste avant ma lame s’est déséquilibrée 
Rap français tiens bon ! Il te reste des rimes à vivre, 
Ne pleure plus c'est moi, je suis venu te délivrer 

(refrain)

Nous voilà dans la salle atmosphère glauque 
Le rap francais baillonné par terre, frôle l'agonie 
Un public déçu me cerne 
Un couplet dans le chargeur, dites-moi comment tenir un concert 
Un dernier regard au rap français 
Et je m'élance à l'avant de la scène, mic en avant 
La voix en l'air 
Chaque mot doit toucher sa cible 
Si ma vocale en traverse dix 

Je vise même le trapéziste 
Flow élastique combinaison de consonnes, 
Des phrases connes qui sonnent 
Appelles-moi aussi joe l'astuce. 
Ce qui se passe t’y penses pas 
Le rap francais en personne qui donne ca 
Il a mal aux pieds, boite et danse à cloche pattes 
On remercie qui ? Qui ? 
Mais où est le black despe 
Il s’est excusé, informé dans l’instant 

Paraîtrait-il qu’on torture le zouk à la rôtissoire 
Mais ça c’est une autre histoire pour le black desperado

They are enemies!

Jimmie Lee Jackson and then Medgar Evers
For Clyde Kennard, hard labor slaving in the yard
For Huey, for Hampton, for Bobby we GODLY

"Self abuse help produce black magic 
Deeply depressed I'm the best that's tragic
You don't really wanna get me all fired up

It goes: red bull and vodka
I'm a psycho like chopper
Glorify the gangster whether handcuffed or locked up
Drink pepsi-cola same friends still rolling
Still swollen, only difference is the heat that I'm holding
You don't really wanna get me all fired up
You'll be the one that ends up with his mouth wired shut
High voltage cause power outages
Set a bad example for the youth
How bout it kids
Madchild's starting an army who wanna join it
Warriors raise your fists if you enjoying it
Soldiers of fortune, chainsaw massacre
Brain react fast when a maniacs after you
Guilt stirs in the silence of my room
Cant hold back with god, still sin follows through
Black jack, fire arms, foreign cars, trying hard
Forest fires, horrified, war cries, iron bars

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, you feeling the same pain
Cant fear what we don't understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upperhand
Black magic

The dark arts, incantations and spell craft
Circles and stars the same fury that hell hath

De humani corporis fabrica
The structure of the human body, welcome to gattaca
Twin girls in the hallway, elevators of blood
Spin words like spider's silk burn when the fires built
Doves fly, straight from the hands of a replicant
Run the blade futuristic cities of the heaven sent
I'm home melted chrome and twisted metal
Surrealist literature from the seamless vessel
The dark arts incantations and spell craft circles and stars
The same fury that hell hath
Feathers of an osprey, leather glove of the falconeer
Treasure chests of gold, tales told then you all come near
Photons and gammas, rays and beams
Sailed with jason and the argonauts in ancient leagues
The lords of the hidden world seance and candlelight
Connections to spirits that dance in the afterlife

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, are we dreaming in vain
Black magic, you feeling the same pain
Cant fear what we don't understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upperhand
Black magic

Shane's brain a hurricane, it's a death march
Never let your dream die, that's the best part
Stormrider man I snap like a pit
Axe murderer, get hacked up to bits
Muscle car, hardbar, heineken, pornstars, tourbus
Truck stop, iron horse, motor cross
Mad paints a poetic self portrait
Warlock that rocks still locked in fortress

Contortionists, swallowers of knives and fire-eaters
Nonconformist performers that wont change
And I wont either
I can see the future like nostradamus
A bridge over troubled waters
Something wicked this way comes
The scythe and the hour glass in a capsule of morphine
Drag chains around the castle grounds
Dressed in darker clothing
Pit and the pendulum, serpent and the rainbow
My lineage the arrow, my bloodline the crossbow

Black magic, spit life with every breath,
Not likely to forget, its like we never left
Black magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain

"But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

The sky above me is silent and empty
I am an island a little freak of melancholy
But these hands they unbead your rosary of wisdom

Bewitched, spellbound I'm found and returned from superstition
You are my martyr I'm a vestige of a revolution
My alma, my mater and now I can let go my old addictive solutions

But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am

Oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

I used to be a connoisseur of hate, self hate, paternal hate
Hate cum gratis I connected every kind
Sipping it like red wine the insecurity was mine
The ties that bind were my design

But oh I am not afraid to be a lone bohemian
I can paint a portrait of myself
I will call me a black Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Come to discover I am your daughter

The sun is still unkind to those like you and me
Seekers of sanctuary though I'm not afraid
I'm sanctified and fortified because you sacrificed

I can call myself Mona Lisa

Own they own property, have they tailor-made bitch

Without the problems, we don't really need em
Every wiz would be a dime, every nigga would be handsome
The only drug would be jaw weed
With a little bombazee, that's all a black man need
Money would be somethin that we burned in the fire

"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-n*gger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

It was us against the world now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between

Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

That will bring you to your knees

Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breath for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you leave for it
Til then having kids, can check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick

"She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat

She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin' all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin' the heat, pilin' the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin' off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin' to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin' on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin' for blood spill, a black widow

She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin' slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin' crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin' heads) in black (pullin' nines)
She's cleared (dodgin' heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin' the clito', the web spinnin'
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin' the lead grinnin', tilted red brimmin'
Makin' the lights inside of your head dimmin'
Givin' head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin' gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin' her, stoppin' her, moppin' her, droppin' her
Hard with bodyguards divin' on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin' her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin' of knockin' her, thinkin' a scheme for knockin' her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Chorus]

She held a white weddin'
Type settin' just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin' her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin' her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin' experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin' in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin' her shirt gaspin', hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin' real dough

Ah
Walking down the street dark, dark, not
Saw a pretty bitch caught my sight
Bitch so fine fine as can be
Bitch you know you belong to me
Drove over said how you be
Bitch you know my names dirtdog dirtMC
Dirt dog I kno what you about
Bitch get the f*ck in the car!
Drove her to my house
Ah to my house
Open the door take off your clothes
Throw'em on the floor took off my clothes
Show'em my dick
Bitch dis something that you'll never forget
On the 1st punch started to scream
On the 2nd punch started to have a bad dream
On the 3rd punch started to cry
Dirt dog I don't want to die
Well shut the f*ck up!!
Pussy ain't nuttin' but a skin on your bone
You can f*ck it you can suck you can leave it alone
25 cents is the regular price
50 cents you can f*ck it twice
75 cents you can f*ck it to the bone
And a dollar worth leave it alone","Black Widow, Pt. 2",Rap

Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket? Ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Nas]
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, f*ck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
On our own people and, f*ck black leaders
Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet-less
All get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation, black zombies

[Chorus]

[Nas]
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas",Black Zombie,Rap

"Magic, I'd like to send this one out to the partner
Pepa MC, magic, and her first born, whatever it may be, magic
Yo Spin, once again help me get this crowd on it's feet

So we can set it off, I've got your back, Salt
You know I'm never soft, yo where's your records at?
Right beside me, ready to give a scratch? Yep, like poison ivy

It's the nineties, the year for change, can you prove it?
I made this beat, I'm an invincible and I produced it
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick

Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list
'Cuz I can be a witch if, they say music is cool
And it can calm the savage beast
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat

A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact
Take out the camera, Salt, why? I wanna picture that
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed
Before I cut up a jam I yell a 'Hocus Pocus'

And right before your eyes you'll understand the name
Musicians and magicians are usually the same
And the fame, proclaim, obtains the stain, will gain a rain
That pours, it soars my brain to yours

Ordained by law to train the poor
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more
It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men
Magic will only work for those who do believe in them

Black magic, it's black magic, do you believe in black magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic, it's black magic
Do you believe in black magic? It's black magic, I believe in

We call this song 'Black Magic' 'cuz it's a fact
Anything that's tragic relates to black
Coincidental? No, here's an example, Jack
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts

Black Sunday or Monday, black tongues or lungs
May 'cause a black sleep, why say black sheep?
Black Sabbath is evil, black market illegal
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy

See, some try to say dark skinned men ain't sexy, true
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light

Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in magic

And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic
And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic

It's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in

In magic, a dimension of sight and sound
Where people see in only shades of brown
And reality is the same as a fantasy
Is this the way you want your world to be?

Not me, I want variety in my society
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see
This is a woman speakin', bringin' door-to-door, seekin'
Tranquility, that ability will keep on repeatin'

To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat
Makin' them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique
Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya
You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh

I proved you wrong, over ten years and still goin' strong
Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long?

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic

And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic
And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic

And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic
And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic",Blacks Magic,Rap

Dein Image kannst du mir nicht weismachen wie Michael Jackson (niemals)

Kurdo, Majoe halten zusammen, so wie Augenbrauen von Kanaks (Brüder)
Will die Newcomer grüßen, doch ich spreche kein Français (leider)

Alles gut, steig ein

"Diese Straße ist mein Königreich,
Ihr ganzen Rapper wenn ihr hörig seid
Die deutsche Szene hat den neuen Trend noch nicht gepeilt,
Doch Blaues Blut ist das Album das die Richtung weist
Ich hab dich groß gemacht,
Ich krieg dich wieder klein,
Karriere aus, vorbei, mit dieser Line
Ich hab dich aufgegabelt,
Du warst mein Embryo,
Dich eingekleidet und gefüttert, Entrecôte
Sag woher kommt dieser Höhenflug?
Ich wollt dir helfen, was ich erntete war böses Blut

Ich bin der King doch hab die meiste Zeit im Dreck gelebt

Unter euch Idioten bin ich ein unbeliebtes Schwein

Und schalte um auf lautlos, keine Reaktion
Meine erste Liebe ? Keine Perspektive
Das sind Argumente, meine Desert Eagle

Not worried about what you do 
Black magic like voodu 
But still proceed to shoot my lyrics right through you 
You ask for a battle son I bring it right to you (oh yeah) 
Rep to Roosevelet Island run with A&B 
Got props all over the world like the B.C.C. 
We be the illest, strong arm like Kevin Willis (Willis) 
I feel it's time to let them know who be the realest 
Fake cats play the back while get this doe 
You can bring your best but you can never match this flow 
Black the new kid, the one you never heard of (heard of) 
Nigga that's on some cool out shit but lyrically committing murder 
Touch tracks upf rom the back up 
Niggas betters top slackin' off and twist this sack up

For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like its a reverend
I tell the truth like, ""Father forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man, this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (straight up)
I'm way up I feel blessed (straight up, straight up), way up I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Yeah, be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit, man

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (straight up)
I'm way up I feel blessed (straight up, straight up), way up I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' over time on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it’s only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who, put it back together? (Aight)

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

From now on I'm impeachin Nautilus  Substitution  Mardi Gras 
Hot Nickel is back from filing at the Shark Bar 
F*ck the Shah, bringin it to you live after dark 
Ask the Psychic Friends, the rhymin-ass cypher with the blends 
Kings of many men, ancient wisdom, sizzles in 
Got a whole crew of girls bent you raped Bell Bottom Tim 
This concluding a broadcast from here to the next millennium 
Off you niggaz execution style ? 

The prime directive is to mostly play a part of utter psychosis 
Not prone to play stationary man hopeless 
Gene pool tumors get rocked without discretion 
Fashion MC's drop now they part of my fall collection 
Dementia earth burners while Earth sinks further into servitude 
Hollow UFO's is comin in 
And bill collectors get clicked on 
Subtle murderous murder verse form a corporation 
In beef we briefly bankrupt but you suck litigation 

The mixed bastard, wherever I lay my stat I oughta booby-trap it 
Super duty tough word, singin some stylish caged graphics 
To kids, who find a hornet's nest just for excitement 
I laughs when some Mars Attacks when I bust up ? 

It's all fantastic when I bank, grand martial arts shouldn't faze me 
I see-through pussy like the Invisible Woman 
Teenagers turned trick pimped by pedophile labels 
They started but fall from, soon to be disabled

Jus the killer Funcrusher, pass off to the left 

And I, cut most meticulous 
Descriptive clip from the hit you done shit on site as ridiculous 
And under my thumb went numb hackers 
When EMS workers caught blood from slug catchers 
Here's the limit dusty but digital 
With a far more rugged approach than Red Asia 
Bust the sundial, wild advanced placement in effect 
For me, it's either rhyme or euthanasia 
Stands brittle but be-boy shell rugged and practical 
Subtle anarchy, climate is unadaptable 
Vulcan, logic, brought upon his destruction 
Attack him at the fulcrum and society can't function 

I've been underground since thirteen literally 
Bombin the whole system up, beautifying the scenery 
Bless the turns I step up off these New Balance 580's on 
No order fool coherency Clinton speak Egyptian 
Get cocked, not back in the jungle, ease up friction 
High dose of energy fuels my fermenting splintering in three sections 
Each capable of launching attack in any direction 
Hook it back up and connect it 
Death-defying, all up on your e-mail addressing 
I defy, any and all attempts at logic 
Gray matter material formulate engineering solids 
Truck the vat scientific frontage off of science? 

Every bloodline is tainted, signifying malignant raps 
Who with bad intentions of boogeymen and death as a source of laughter 

Yeah your precious family tree'll end this century 
No traditions to pass down, ?spend your way out of eternity?

Fancy, tryin to eat, just livin 
I want to be paid, MC, berzerker

I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money buku
My beats is bangin’, f*ck what you rappin’, who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you

You itsy bitsy furry fright and frickin' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kitties, Mike, I'mma rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work, do the deed and then dash, ditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run our brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke like we're fuckin' magicians

No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen

I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluations
I'm a phallus for Johnson and Jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get deface'd
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced, face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you like ""Mellow out man, just relax, it's really not that complicated""
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just as sane as you explain'ed
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is derange'd

This Run The Jewels is, murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it then lose it, junkies simply abuse it
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, I'm pushin coffin
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin', waitin'

So take part as the four begin to spark
And the pinnacle as things get critical
I'm sweating bullets, but I'm cooler than a Popsicle
Pull off a miracle as a black symbol
That overcomes yet any obstacle
I scraped the floor, my knees get scarred
But no way I give in, cause I gotta take charge
Like when my foes want to make things drastic
I melt em down like real cheap plastic

Free Boona, cause he got jammed up and ain't sayin' nothin'
Even though I was on parole gotta keep it on me

These niggas think they so hard, pull they hoe card
Twin Glocks blow his toes off, knock his clothes off
Hundred racks in my Goyard, resting so long
Bitches, can't come in here unless they cut their phones off

Homie you f*ck with Booka
Put that on Tooka
Rob who? I be with all the robbers and shooters
Bitch f*ck yo' mood
My lil' shawty gon' (?)
If that .40 go rah
.45 must go boom

Please don't, tryna play hard
Get your face spurred
(?)got 20 bodies, bitch it's a graveyard
Niggas playin' on that Instagram better log off
Use your head, AR pistol hit it, it's gon' fall off

Gun charge wish I got it dropped
Let them Ks off
So hard, had some dime bags look like eightballs
Put a bag, all on his head, he get paid off
Lay low, if he cut his dreads, knock his fade off

I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now you'se can't leave
You opened the door god, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is

Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes
Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line
Donating proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositing checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright
Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write
Is it ""Oochie Wally Wally"" or is it ""One Mic""?
Is it ""Black Girl Lost"" or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though
Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov
I get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
The street dreaming, all y'all niggas living through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea
And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem B? You not as hard as me
Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest till you on one knee
You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga
Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga

Pair of shades on, who the coolest nigga on sight?
Tell 'em hide that, where the f*ck you buy that?
I can't even try that, glad I got my own shit wit me

But you ain't got a Swisher then we ain't gon' session

Breakin' this down get ya fingers so messy
You gon' put a hole in the blunt, keep rushin'
Shoulda used a grinder ho, then buzz check it out

Got a gram of the wax if you need a dab hit
Must keep it in a jar cause these niggas cabbage

Blunted, blunted, know you can smell me comin'
Said blunted, blunted, everybody always like ""sell me somethin'""

You can roll one of mine just wrap it like a mummy

So gone think I left a couple nugs at ya crib
Make sure you hit a nigga when you found 'em

Said blunted, blunted, if I smell another seed I'm runnin'
Said, no sticks, takin' shots while you hittin' bricks
Know I got the juice and you niggas nowhere in the mix
Be consistent, what you smoke hit or miss
I roll up OG every intermish
O-OG, make a mothafucka OD
Hit ya body like morphine, army
Babysittin' the blunt, I'll get you a car seat
F*ck what it cost me, these dividends is all goin' to the medicine
It ain't one of the 7 sins, rollin' with these 7 grams
Sorry baby if there's weed hangin' out the end

Get your street knowledge every posse know that come again 
Bo Bo Bo Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack 
The only way to deal with racism if you're black 
Well  seven in the morning I woke up to jog 
Rushed out the door to inhale the smog 
As I ran  I began to wonder 

Should I produce or should I tour this summer 
Well just that second I heard stay where you are 
Before I could stop I was hit by a cop car 
I laid on the pavement like I was hurt 
Then a redneck cop jumped out with a smirk 
He said, ah boy you better watch where you run 
As he poked my side with the barrel of his shotgun 

I said Officer man I ain't do nothin 
He said what's that word you n----s use, ya frontin? 
Well ya frontin, so why were you running down the street? 
At this time I had stood to my feet and said Wait a minute 
And that's when he did it, he hit me in the face with his gun I wasn't 
With it so 
On the ground was a bottle of Snapple, I broke the bottle in his 
Fucking Adam's apple 

As he fell his partner called for backup well, I had the shotgun and 
Began to act up with that 

Well I threw down the gun and began to run 
I got back in no time and loaded the nine 
First I took two clips and then I took two more 
I was out the window cause by now they were right at my door 
I took three shots and then I laid 
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade 
It went boom like a supernova 
Badges arms heads legs cops were all over 
I jumped out the fire escape down to the street and I started to run 

You know I couldn't feel my feet, I was weak, I said to myself Holy shit! 
My shirt had filled with blood I didn't know I got hit but there's no 
Time to stop no time to explain man I'm in too deep with this everyday 
Ghetto pain 
Black men are judged by their clothes 
Black women are looked at as hoes 
So I as one of these uppity niggas 
Can only rely on the sound of a trigga going 

Well I staggered down the street to an old bookstore 
Called the Tree of Life (Yo D it ain't there no more) 
But when it was boy I was lucky 
Cause in the basement is where they stuck me 
When I awoke at the 14th hour 
Three black women had gave me a quick shower 
I stayed a while and escaped in a truck 
Driven by two guys, Rakim and Chuck 

What the f*ck I asked as I laid there How many guys do you drive a day 
There? Chuck said many, Rakim said plenty it's an everyday thing when 
You're willing to sing a song

Well I threw down the gun and began to run 
I got back in no time and loaded the nine 
First I took two clips and then I took two more 
I was out the window cause by now they were right at my door 
I took three shots and then I laid 
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade 
It went boom like a supernova

Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?
Running round the corner hustlin' wit brother and them.
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?
Popping gats motherfucker when you know you got his
I don?t think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Always in stores, with major whores
Doing things, bling-bling.
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin',
Smokin', always chokin' indo weed
With the sticky in yo hand fa sho
Everybody round, cause they know you got mo'
Where's the Cristal, you like to get wild
You like to dip in yo six and shit
Rollin through them streets, popping CPT.

"Said little bitch, you can't f*ck with me

I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a f*ck
'Bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes
Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say goals
Bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some Bape
I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face
I'm like okay
I'll let him do what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills
I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me
Their baby father run a bill

You a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way
You can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts
Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip
I bet, you dip, he dip, she dip
I say, I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that li'l bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they niggas is safe

I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like frosted flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail

I don't mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

Uh, picture your body soaking, bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers
Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels
Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feel
Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty
I was thinking you can ride me, miss Kentucky derby
Why dream about it, let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage
Gotta moan it, damn it, feels good
Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood
Damn right, so unreal
This year of the Ace, bet you she know the deal

By the way you biting on your lip just gave me confirmation
Was that Chanel Five? Very sexy fragrance
Are those your real eyes? Can tell you're partially Asian
But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated
And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest
Body to body, wet as Dasani
Bet if I hit the spot, I'll make you tsunami
Change up the sheets, no time to sleep
Asked her what she thinking, she reply that I'm a beast
Yeah she replied that I'm a beast
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets

Young boys thats on my strip
Will kill anything I say ride on
Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work
'Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work

Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ride wit three K's and I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It's eat time, me and my niggas buffeting

Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ride wit three K's and I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It's eat time, me and my niggas buffeting

Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did

You know we not backin down
Hundred drum like hold that doe
Diamonds flash like Kodak, though
Straight cash nigga f*ck that loan
Seven digits on that phone
Money so long smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money tryna put my 'cuz on
Bitch I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, Money, Murder Petey Rollack (Soundview waddap)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavy)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch Hurricane Irene

Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ride wit three K's and I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain't no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It's eat time, me and my niggas buffeting

Behind the colors that you fly
Love just one nation

You won't say, you're sorry
There is no other choice

Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Whoa, we may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Violence brings one thing
More more of the same
Military madness
The smell of flesh and burning pain

So I sing out to the masses
Stand up if you're still sane
To all of us gone crazy
I sing this one refrain

We can chase down all our enemies
Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Whoa, we may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

And I sing power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all
Power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all

We may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Say we can chase down all our enemies
We can even bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world into pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

"Intro:

I'll just sway...
This's the way it goes down 
Def Squad
Nine-pound
Check this here

Verse One:

The E gets wicked, no need for the biscuit
The green-eyed funkdafied brother coming wicked
I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, 'cause I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots (daaat's right)
I'm dynamite with this mic
I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
to your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin

Chorus:

Brothers can't see me                                \
'cause my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi  / repeat 2X
...
Brothers can't see me

Verse Two:

It goes one for the trouble, two for the show
Aiyyo, I'm gettin airplay like The Most Beautiful
I'm the mack, I made Goldy turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone (yeah)
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
to specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-are-I-see-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, ""I shoulda snared that""

Chorus

Verse Three:

Complete this puzzle, what Squad beat up like Russell Simmons
And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape
(and make much sense when he's kickin fool) cause I constantly keep shitting
and y'all constantly keep listening
Yeah, who can it be now, watch out
Flying through the air with wings E Double doing my thing

Chorus",Bomdigi,Rap
"Wenn sich das Niveau hebt, und es endlich los geht
Guckt ihr, als wenn ihr alle hinterm Mond lebt
Spürt ihr den Flow, die Show geht jetzt los
Rapps kommen gross, es ist allen Recht so
Fette Beats kommen in dein Ohr wie Q-Tips
Klingt gut nech komm näher damit du Schub kriegst
Meine Crew frisst Mics zum Mittag wie Schnittlauch
Sogar wenn ich nüchtern bin kling ich, als wenn ich shit rauch
Wenn ihr Hits braucht, müsst ihr nicht ABBA hören
Denn hier kommen krasse Gören, die Mics wie Tabak burnen
Dieser Beat schlägt das Trommelfell windelweich
Denn wir lieben den Scheiß wie kleine Kinder Klingelstreich

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich
Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib uns mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Denn wir kriegen nicht genug von diesen Deichkind-Style

Check mal den aus, die Gören sind am Start, ja
Ohne Fahrplan, weil wir sowieso schon da waren
Spitzt jetzt die Ohren, die Kids kommen groß raus
Weil wir bei Showdown sind sag ich dir Prost drauf
Wenn ich los lauf, sieht es für dich doof aus (Wort drauf)
Beats machen uns Höher als auf'm Hochhaus
Ich bin so drauf, weil in diesen Kreis pass ich rein
Also nick bitte, Digger, falls du weißt, was ich mein

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch

Jungs mit woop Style, schüttelt die Köpfe
Mädels mit Hot-Tops schüttelt die Zöpfe
Vier Nordlichter geben sich hier heute die Ehre
Also werft eure Hände in die Atmosphäre.
Denn das hier mutiert garantiert zum Dauerbrenner
Drei Deichkind Sänger, mit Nina auf einem Nenner
Brennen wir länger, 1 für Liebhaber, 2 für Kenner
Einmal drin, kriegst du nich genug wie Cliffhanger
Heut zerhack ich mein Blatt, als wär ich Wasser blass
Dies Deichkind, dies ist der Anlass
Also was Junge, was Mädel, gebt Gas
Es ist zu krass, denk du, schwing was du hast zum Bass

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich
Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib uns mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Denn wir kriegen nicht genug von diesen Deichkind-Style

Seht euch vor, denn hier kommt der Frechdachs
Die Beats treiben, wie Cowboys Rinder in Texas
(Check das) Ich klecker mit Worten, so wie ein Dreckspatz
Und sage (Piep, Piep) Guten Appetit, wie schmeckt das?
Wenn ich traditionsbewusst, das Mikrofon benutz
Kommt ihr nicht mehr runter, wie Junkies bei Drogensucht
Weil der Scheiß nach oben muss, wie Piloten in Jumbojets
Machen wir im Punkto Raps die Tracks rund und fett
Ihr kennt das, also warum guckt ihr so verdutzt
Und tanzt so heftig, dass ihr mit euren Füßen den Boden schrubbt
Macht den Walkman an, wir füttern die Stöpsel
Also nickt jetzt mit dem Beat und schüttelt die Köpfe

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich

Denn wir kriegen nicht genug von diesen Deichkind-Style

Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will

Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da f*ck you doin'

Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe

When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (f*ck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
I ain't gotta say shit
He felling me and you all bent outta shape
'cause I'm about to take who you with
Keep crunk
The run in my blood make a nigga jump jump
His body was banging
His teeth was pearly white
He had those strong keen features like Mario Van Peebles
His check bones was chiseled
His smile made me sizzle
His cologne had me sniffen' him from all the way home
I want to smell this nigga and I this nigga to smell me

[Verse 2]
So the night went on
We keep it in each other sides
He kept coming around me just to see my behind
I was being so flirtatious with the body language
I was so anxious to make those arrangements
Tangle him up in the sheets
Transaction about to happen anytime that we meet
I put one foot in front of the other
Stopped to look in back of my nameplate in the mirror
Gotta make sure my lipstick is straight and not smeared
Its clear he wants me severely
So I slide over up to his ear and whispered it gently
F*ck Me! F*ck Me! F*ck Me!
You on the other hand nowhere to be found
Told you he was going to pee
But he came to find me
He felt you standing around
I'm a f*ck him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You came to the bathroom
And guess what you saw
You saw my big brown titties popping outta my bra
With his mouth on my nipple like a suction cup
I was wrapped around him like an octopus
He was rubbing me down so I couldn't get up
I know you hate me now but I don't give a f*ck
If he was yours like you said he was
His dick wouldn't have got so hard when I gave him is first hook
Ever since then he be loving on me diligently
Being all I need a nigga to be
He got me crawling the walls
I never been so quick to come up outta my drawers

[Outro]
You damn motherfucking right
I fucked that nigga
And I'm a f*ck him again
Over and over again
Diligently bitch!
You know why I fucks with him and he fucks with me
'cause I'm fly

"The boom boom bap, the tap a tap tap
Well, that's the beat of my life
A weak heart drop, oh, poppa don't stop
Bittersweet about life

You know that barroom belles, well, they're calling
You know their perfume smells like blood
If looks could kill singing dollar, dollar bill
Well, that's the beat of my life

A Zigaboo kick, a Jimmy Chank lick
Well, that's the beat of my heart
A come again cut, I'll be telling you what
That's the betterest part

You know the barroom boys, well, they've fallen
And juice joint Jane got high
If looks could kill singing dollar, dollar bill
On the street of my heart

To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
Play it over and over again
Play it over and over again, let me know, let me know, let me know
I am yours and I'm ready to go

The yes, yes y'all was the siren call
To come around to my life
I said big beat drum, hear it kitty come, come
That's the sound of my life

The Brewski Point was calling
That got bellywash blood in my heart
The boom boom rap, the tap a tap tap
And that's only the start

I'll wait till December, baby
I'll wait till my hands stay still
And then in December, baby
I'm in for the cure or kill

That's my right hand man we like the Bobbsey Twins
You got my back, I got your back when the shots begins
We grew up in the slums, broke bread together
When worse came to worse, rolled out the weather
Had faith, knew it couldn't be this bad forever
And once the sun shined, it could only get better
Birds of a feather, we on the same page
Since high school, four crews, whatever came our way
Your kids is my kids, vice-versa
You ain't ask who the beef with, only where the burner
Never blink a eye, or back down just hold the fort down
From Q.B. to Strong Isle, my soldiers running wild, we wyldin'

It's 32,000 troops in New York harbor
We out planned, out our minds pushing forward
We a powder keg about to explode
Wish we had a man like Hamilton to lighten the load
Send the word, get 'em
He want to fight, he got the hunger
Yeah, I was just like him when I was younger
Uh, head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr, but look
Dying is easy young man, livin' is harder
It's gon' be pools of blood in New York Harbor (Rah!)
Gunfire and cannonballs, it's on, son

Nuff a fe we youth dem turn to

"[Verse 1]
I'm a mother that gave birth young, so what about it
Does it mean right away that I'm wrong
All in due time, well my time is right now
So don't ask me who, where, what when or how
I know I got me and a good partner beside me
One that will never try to desert of defy me
So who are you to tell me how to run my family
I can plan it by myself, I need nobody planning me
'Cause yeah I might be young, but my stability's correct
Everything about my little one I must protect
What she sees, what she hears, and everything surrounding
A decent state of mind is what my daughter will be found in

Chorus:

Born 2 B.R.E.E.D.
Young mother be thankful, be strong
The fact that you're young, it ain't wrong
A mother I will try to be
Tha fact is, I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D.

[Verse 2]
So tell me what do the kids learn at school
How to pack a pistol, how to play a class fool
Then they blame the parents when the kid plays hooky
Subject to getting shot is something that I wouldn't want to be
Maybe it is safer to stay within your home
Protecting yourself from getting a bullet within your dome
It's something to think about, the word safe
I often wonder if there exists such a place
Whether on a bus, a train, or plain walkin'
You're subject to the devious ones that might be hawkin'
I'll teach my child to respect every day as a blessing
And follow the path of her future lesson by lesson

Chorus

[Verse 3]
So ask me again if I need ghetto assistance
There's food on my table and my baby's not wearing piss pants
I could teach my child more at home that you could ever
Corrupt the youthful mind I produce, that will be never
This one will learn from me, the other babies too
'Cause what you teach is censorship, I want to teach what's true
So bother me not with our by the book method
If I was already deaf I would be getting deafer
I know exactly what I'm doing, in it I believe
My life is in my offspring 'Cause I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D.

Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug

His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
But nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

This is a story bout a young nigga
Who's mama was a whore and his daddy was a drug dealer
Ridin' 'round the corner from 'em was the spot
They sold weed, lace, base, heroin and marijuana

His role model was an older nigga
Who kept a wad of hundreds 'cause he had a whole lot of money
Now keep in mind this is 'round the time that
Miami niggas was really tryin' to put it down

That's back when the pimp game played out
That next year crack cocaine came out
And it all started in the suburbs
But only rich folks could afford to go and smoke that good dope

And yo they used to call it free-base
But when it made it to my block, me and my boys called it Crack Rock
We used to cook it up and bag it up and sell 'em
Nickels and dimes to any bitch that was buyin'

Shorty's gonna be

So he's gonna be

So he's gonna be
A straight thug

Mama was a G
Daddy was a G
Nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

And when he first hit middle school
He was a typical, ordinary, everyday ass dude
Around the time eighth grade came around
He had done made up his mind, a nigga can't lay down now

His first job, he was a watch out
He had to scream one time every time the cops hit the block
We used to call him Bo Brown
'Cause when he came around, close shop nigga, shut it down

Them lil' two-hundreds
That was a lot of money for a young nigga sittin' 'round not doin' nothin'
Plus his mama had a newborn from an old nigga out the hood
Who don't do shit for him

They go another bill, another mouth to feed
Oh well, yo a nigga couldn't stop there
He gotta keep food in his crib and keep the lights on
Ain't like his daddy's comin' back home

Now just imagine the role of a thirteen year old
Who playin' head of his household, now that shit's cold
But then again I suppose
You already know how the shit go

Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be

So he's gonna be
A straight thug

Mama was a G
Daddy was a G
Nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

He advanced from watch out man to lieutenant
And now he got two feet waist deep in it
And he control the whole operation
But it's kinda different 'cause he's dealin' with some stiff competition

And everybody wants to be buddies
All of a sudden friends but then again all they see is money
And he ain't never too flashy wit it
Not into cars and jewels, just nice clothes and new shoes

Half of the money went straight to his mama
But the other half, you know, the kid had to keep it stashed
But it's kinda hard to hide drug money
But it's worse bein' a dope but none of this shit's worth dying for

But when it comes to livin', money's nothin'
Bein' dead is free now tell me, what would you rather be?
Don't tell me, tell it to your child
Make your talk worthwhile and the rest, he'll figure it out

Shorty's gonna be

"Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be
'All you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany
I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know that the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope
And knew one day you would find it
And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing

I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning

If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: ""Don't let me slip""
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you
""You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane""
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go with me damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that occurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
""I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't want to listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild""

But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
>From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child

The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild

This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype

Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he music a grande yeah he got it goin on

So I'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine

Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play

I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis

Bourgeois 'cause her shoes alone cost a grand
Ghetto 'cause she cuss too much and talk with her hands
She say she don't f*ck wit rap since Mase got saved
But baby got back like mace got spray
You know the bourgeois type, ass boombastic
Mabelline queen, titties all plastic
Niggaz front with they tank on empty
They ask for e'rythang 'cause the top off her Bentley

Did alotta wrong with alotta good fellows
But I got my shit together (Hello!)
I took my hustlin ways from them scufflin days
To eight million copies on my resume
I moved right out the hood, 'cause I don't like the hood
I tell all my people to think twice in the hood
The police; man they don't even lie
'cause they got Spud and Boone and 'Trelle up in Riker's
And I just like what the money can get
A little head e'ry now and then so honey can spit
Chrome tips, a hundred an forty four of them shits
And a big ass crib cuz...

A boughetto pimp loose and I know it 'cause I come to party
late, smellin like weed, no matter who throw it
I'm in the curl cap, didn't get paid but done a rap
Dem ain't Rolex diamonds - what the f*ck you done to that?!
Throwin trash out the Benz on the highway
But the old school still spillin all in the driveway
And if it stop, never a towtruck pull me home
Fuckin I keep the socks, had the jewelry on
I'm like a pimp in the 80's, a Reverend Run
Preachin it to em, gassin em up like Chev-e-ron
Got the D's the beeps and the televis-ion
And my Sprint (Brrrrr..) like a boughetto telethon

Sorry I'm so demanding, sick of dancing back to mansion and

Of this big ole butt, big ole butt
Thick legs, big ole jugs legs stick like rims on the truck
Take 'em to the crib, yeah we gon' f*ck

You could call me a freak, I like to get buck
And I don't have to do much to make him get it up

Only rich girls we only buy the bottles
But like a porn star I'm best when to swallow

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be

Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Big fish in a small pond

The Westside connects with me and south central
And a drag from the zig zag can't f*ck with the
Philly's
Holding down the wild west like a kid they
Call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown hold of
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a crome pistola
Now who want to fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear deom the Surplus
Since a teen I chased the green the crack scene
King
Lolos Cornishes and Bagguetts on my pieces
So recognize these real G's take the cheese

Five generations of taking pictures with Grand-Ams
The Chevrolet Slim Shady, there's no way you can save me
Bass boat flakes, you never seen such
Roll down my window like ""Who I am doesn't mean much""
Burning tread off a thousand-dollar tires with a clean touch
Six hundred horses running behind the mean clutch, bitch I'm

Glaze on the dash, leather is smelling like Ralph Lauren
Feels like I'm watching television on a couch snorin'
I must be dreaming leaning back inside this chariot
Hitch on the back of this truck, my Harley I carry it
A chalice in wonderland, fill up my cup with
Jack D and take my fucking keys so that I don't, wreck it
Let me come sit on the passenger side and check it
How does it feel from over here? Oh, bless it
This is for all the Chevy's that I collected
Big trucks, low riders, whatever the best is
To you man I just want to give you a message
Uh', I used to sit on sidewalks like everyday
Watching punks and chumps in donks get hella paid
But I just focused on my vision and never quittin'

We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin

Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?

Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs with aimless slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!

Do five you now, why'all die later
Come to your wake, look at you; ""Hi hater""

"Cruising down the street in my six four
Jockin' the freaks clocking the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car trying to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded twelve gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
Went to the spot where my homebys chill
The fellows out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my six four Impala
They greet me with a forty and I started drinking
And from the eight-ball my breath start stinking
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross cold knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped my six four round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin' home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

"Sammy B is on the cut
Sammy B is on the cut
Sammy B is on the cut
Sammy B

Ha hah, one two (one two, one two)
How we gonna do this?
What we have here (ya)
Is the Jungle Brothers (yeah)
On a black piece of wax (yeah)
My name is Mike G (uh huh)
On the mix is Sammy B
First in line to kick the rhyme, Jungle Brother (Shazam) yeah
One big scratch (that's all I ask for) here we go

Well, I'm a sure shot shooter and I'm the big shot
The big shot, yes the biggest, and I know I'm hot
Say I'm the baddest, just the baddest and I'm on the top
Sucker MC's try to stop me, but I won't stop
As I adjust and discuss all the rhymes I bust
I leave 'em all in the dust when I start the thrust
They try to catch me on the mic, but I'm hard to chase
I'm the ace in the place kickin' rhymes in your face
I'm outright, outstanding, outrageous, I'm smoking
Never play on the mic, no jivin', no joking
Not a double-talker, so I don't double-talk
Ladies clock, finger-pop to the rhythm of a hawk
But I ignore the temptation, avoid the sensation
Reputation's at stake, but I won't break
I just chill (ill) ill, let loose all my skill
I make a list of all the ladies that my skill will thrill

Now, my tasty technique tantalizes your taste
As my rhymes rock and roll right through this place
I never fade away for forfeit or fess
And my beat is a beat bound to be best
Clowns craze and chase me 'cause I'm so cool
As I ridicule the rule and fool the fool
Ignite the party, excite the crowd
I'll make the quietest person wanna go and get loud
I'll make the hot get hotter when I start to rap
And my reward for goin' off is to hear people clap
I'm a monster for music, and my means are to move
Guys and gals'll get gray when it's time to groove
I'm a sexy sucker, but the mind is sane
Having nothing to lose but only goals to gain
By my side, I'm supplied with the best of the best
Sammy B and Shazam which means there's no contest

Well, I'm an MC debater, rhyme regulator
Cool creator, rapper, not a raper
A damn good fighter, party highlighter
Lady exciter, writer, not a biter
Suckers lookin' to me, say, ""what you think they see?""
They see a fresh, fantastic, fly, funky MC
They try to study my style, use and abuse it for a while
'Til I take 'em to court and have 'em put on trial
I let Mike G judge 'em, put 'em on the case
Sammy B, you be my lawyer to put 'em to disgrace
You see, I never have to worry, 'cause they both got my back
Sammy B for the fader, Mike G for the rap

The more suckers I burn, the better suckers will learn
That Mike G is takin' his turn to earn
Havin' the time, the rhyme, I'm gonna get mine
And it pushes the thought of suckers further out of my mind
'Cause as I rhyme to my peep, suckers smoke the cheap
And butlers take down my orders from the words that I speak
Because I'm strong like a horse and loud like thunder
You mess with me, you'll be sixty feet under
In a jungle with a force, on a straight-forward course
And if you don't join the jungle, you should feel remorse (yeah)

Ah yeah, yes yes y'all and you don't stop
You keep on to the break of dawn
You keep on to the break of dawn
You gotta be on time when you bust your rhyme
And you can't be wack when you rap the rap
You gotta get on the mic and do your best
For the people in the north, south, east and west
Like you can't judge a book by it's cover
If you listen, you will learn from a jungle brother
Like that y'all, and you don't stop
You keep on to the early morn
Hey yo, I'm outta here",Braggin & Boastin,Rap

Couldn't do it, make me wonder how a world maintain 
Got emcees frontin' total masquerade 
Screamin' toast had to touch them up with my blade 
Cut is caught brothers still fallin' to this day 
And all is face say why'd have to be this way? 
Five 'cent is the culture 
Make me pop you like a vulture 
Amplify my mic and let the rhyme take the clutcher 
The rains of the rhythms with some boom boom cat 
Not enough to break your back, just so you react. 
My counter act's my counterpart 
Takin' your heart 
You made a move to pull my plug now that ass got sparked 
All I seeing and knowing is my business and I divide to multiply 
And give thanks to most high 
24/7 brothers got to make a living 
Overcome the odds is the only decision 
Cast like my pawn with your third eye vision 
Slip up in the brain raise a sharp incision 
Streets full of clowns trying to rob your part 
When the herb come knocking send them home with a not 
I got my house pumped 
Crunch a problem with my luck 
Coming soft to the hole and get your whole game stuffed 
As we sway the dance halls from heaven to hell, 
As the sun do shine, JBeez rock well.

Cut you short and escort you to my innermost thoughts 
Dreams of fighting for my freedom in the most high courts 
But jump shots get blocked and dreams get shattered 
And when the day turns night, souls get bruised and battered. 
Cheap labor for a favor from your cotton picking neighbor, 
Got to work your ass off just to show you got flavor, 
Life savers won't help you when your breaking your back 
And Uncle Sam keep talking about raising his tax 
I look at heaven and see myself rolling in seven or eleven 
So I can recoup this suit that I'm spending 
Pray to God with divine intervention all my life 
Repent for my sins because I don't want strife 
Release from contracts to make new contacts 
The game gets played but still remains the facts 
That I got to wake up and see the brood of charades 
'Cause I'm still living in the modern age slave trade 
Rapping on holy water, 
Looking for divine order 
Life goes on, but still the rhyme gets shorter 
Seal my fate, there's no escape 
But still I'm straight, 
I'm back on track, shaking off the dead weight 
The time has come, for me to free my soul 
Grab hold of my heart and take full control 
'Cause no matter what happens when times get hard, 
I still stand my ground and use the force of God 

I got so much funky shit inside my brain, 
I couldn't explain, couldn't explain

Brothers buck wilding 
And JBeez is always styling 
We bring the raw, 
The real hardcore, 
Giving you more than what you bargained for 
Son, so your ass is best to run when 
You see me coming 
I'm taking it back to the essence, 
Soul tracks I'm blessing 
Pass the mic over here,

"Brand Nubian function
A junction of three
Collaborating in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms
Tap a soul
'Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo Black it's kinda ill
We don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is ""Brand Nu""
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
400 years and we're made to feel cursed
But now it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

You have to stand as a black man
Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of my force
See me riding on a jet black horse at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel

Not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind deaf dumb and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold
(The black, the beautiful, the bold)
Now if this falls short I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasa Kuma, Ahmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To put it exact dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel

It's time to be brave, say I'm not afraid
Not anymore, I used to be calm
Now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way

This thing movin' too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant

But it's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way you scared of him
He's scared of bein' hurt again

It's time to let go
Let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know we might never part

Baby, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
This is your day
This is your day

Straight into a cave to show me the way

Now I'm turning the page

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave

I wouldn't take back
Anything that I've gone through
Now I pray for strength
For anything that I'm gonna do

Whether joy or it's pain
I'm still okay
I'm gonna be all right 'cause I'm not afraid

No, I am brave, say I'm not afraid

Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my picture
Now baby, but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cause the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
Plus ? I didn't get mad did I?
Y-Y-y'member, 'member when
W-W-When I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
and on the way out
My very best pinstripe caught a nail

To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uh I need you, I just need you

Wasn't countin' all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you

Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and da label
Spring water while holdin' you're age koo

But I'm on to my zone like O.J. Jones
Beano brown, cancel dis bitch, I'll buy another one
It's my world you lil' squirrel tryna get a nut bitch

"F*ck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan

And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
F*ck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon

Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doing, long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parlay, you wonder why I'm straight

"I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you, girl, but not see you at all
I wanna make up, but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right
""Sitting here waiting on you""

I hate you, you hate me, but still can't escape ""we""
And all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart broke, lovestruck
Telling y'all, ""It ain't me.""
Life without you, girl, is something that I can't see
I ain't gon' lie, say, ""I don't get lonely""
But there's only so much, I could kick it with the homies
And somebody told me that you already moved on
I broke up with you, you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now, at least wait a couple weeks
Got me looking like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks, but it feel like you still there
No matter how I clean, I'm still finding your hair
Or some shit you forgot, or I'm standing in that spot
Where you came so hard, I didn't think that you would stop
But, quiet as it's kept, I know you miss me just a little
Washed my sheets when you left but still smell you on my pillow

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You ain't call me last night, what you trying to be? Strong?
You'll call yourself stupid when you finally hear this song
Cause I would've took you back, I was waiting to, in fact
All you had to do was holler, girl, I would've just collapsed
And fell into a trap and started to relapse
And your ass never called so it just never happened
Now I'm thinking Jasmine, Tanya, Cheraine
Some ex's I can call that'll probably ease the pain
I tried to follow through, but I wound up calling you
Hanging up before a ring, girl, it's really all on you
But you wanna get into it, make me mad, push my buttons
Got us tripping over little stuff that don't mean nothing
I'm sick of the suffering, the fighting, the fussing
What happened to the love in the late night discussions
'Bout children, and family, the future, the plan
And now it's all over cause you couldn't understand me

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

Started missing you again last night
'Til I remembered all the reasons that your ass love to fight
It's like, dude
I really wanted this to work
But you, had to get your shit together first
And what's worse
I really wanted you to stay
But I needed you to leave cause we was fighting everyday
All right, not everyday, I know that's a lot on it
We was supposed to be companions
We was more like opponents
Don't this song make you wanna do it one more time?
Could I still be the only dude that's on your mind?
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm hoping that you not
I would take you back quick, girl, without a second thought
But I'm caught up in my pride and I can't make the call
Didn't want to break up, just a break, that's all
It's been a long time, I know I probably shouldn't have left you
Cause your the only woman that I wanna sleep next to

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You say you're sick of me and I say I'm sick of you
But we crazy 'bout each other, girl, what we gon' do?
Said I needed you to leave, but I hate to see you go
Can't make up my mind, girl, I just don't know
I wanna make this work but I'm sick of the struggle
Girl, what I gotta do to make you realize I love you?
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I just don't feel you
But find another man, and I just might kill you

You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial 
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown

What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all 
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

You need to leave him alone and roll

Poppin' trunks, poppin' grillz, still poppin' seals
High up in the hill with ma mind on millz
Piece of chain swangin', bank roll, shiny grill
Baby, I got million dollar dreams with ma mind on cream
I'm in that mean, green machine clean on nineteens
Flat screens in the headrest, swangin' like a swang set
Brandy wine, paint wet, comin' down - that's a fact
I'm in the 'lac chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that Kush flower; I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than the street lights, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta mac, game sharper than a thumbtack

Shit done hit the fan; better cover your nose
And the Kush done start burnin'; better cover your clothes (that's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on twenty-four razors

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside

And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it

Gotta embrace the bullseye and
Let em all know that they're looking in a mind of a monster

I just wanna tell them if I had it my way
You'd never have a motherfucking heart to start with

It's a cold ass world, better pack an ice pick
And bring it down to the depths of this
Over shadow respecting this
Expecting this to be conceited and heavenless
But never live, never settle again, any better when
Life's weighing my patience, making me feel heaven
And if I have any real feelings, that's relevant
Blessed to never forget like an elephant
Don't fit like shotgun shells up in the derringer
Amongst the square pegs feeling more like a cylinder
Swing to the symphony, metrodone
And the musical gravitation are pullin' ya
Close for microphones and earholes are fitted with zeros
Or forked tongues waking the dead
Makin' some new foes, a simple stain
And permanent pain on a mission to take the clear throat
Y'all know this attractin' hope
But the lack there of be the true scope but no rope
Scapegoats and sailboats soon become
Sinking ships with escape rafts of cut throats
Stay afloat cause we back again, and we destined to crack heads
We just found in the top 10, the rest can drop dead
There's no stoping when the twins are infectin'
With Twiztid connection

You see I'm trying to get the punani 
But you just want to rock me ooh check it 

So get your ride on ride the thundercloud and broom broom broom 
Because I gotta gotta get some el bow room 
So I can Bangkok better yet knock Italy 
But raindrops keep falling on my couch, try to sit with me 
Tampering up my program, so I play another slow jam 
It's not an ancient Chinese secret, you should know man 

But you insist on stay and playing Genesis 
I gotta put an end to this, baldergash, haul ass 
And don't come knocking my door, with the cockle-doodle-doo 
I'm talking the his and his and hers, Three's Company too 
So step to the step to the rear 
And don't come back now, hear? 

Ah to the break y'all (break y'all, yeah) 
Ah to the break y'all (break y'all, made it!) 
To the break y'all (break y'all, nah!) 
To the break y'all (break y'all break, break!) 

The CB's, the CB's, they're here! 
I'm checking my mirror from the rear,
Locks are closer, than they appear 
The time is near for you to drop your beer and get your nuts again 
But ain't no haps your dick isn't there 

You're thinking that, ""Oops, I made a mistake"" 
You say, ""F*ck Nell Carter, come on Jimmy, give me a break"" 
You made a mistake on the first take 
Trying to break a leg for take two 
You should of ate your Wheaties 
and Petey might of made a breakthrough 

You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position 
Wishing he would listen, so you start to kissing 
It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline 
You aimed, you fired, there you go, limp figures 
So you take and then play the role of friend and talk 
Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk 
Baby Bubba youse a goner, ahh, you'se a goner 

It's fucker up, when your dick is playing tricks on you 
So you pop fizz, what a relief, beef stroke it up 
My man, got your thing, in your hand, say, ""I, I think I can!"" 
Damn this never happened before, yeah sure that's what they all say 
Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is saucy 

What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted 
It's a pile of pew, pick up your glove and say, ""Yo I got it!"" 
Hoping you won't drop you thought you had it made like Kay
What more could go wrong, you got the right one baby! 
Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows 
that you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's

Walking up and then down the strip 
Looking for some hip so I can skip 
I spotted this honey dip, and her friend tried to sell me a script 
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the old Gus 
So I'm getting a bus, as I thrill at the disgust 

Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business 
Dipping from a distance, in an instance I got the digits 
and blew a kiss to her 
That old stank hoe, was mad I didn't speak to her 

I hooked up with the one that looked nice 
Took her mind, like an ice!
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice 
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill 
They told her to keep that booty still 
I been through more hoes than the pill 

Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete  
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (break) 
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was getting knocked 
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop 
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell 

Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail 
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
Like a belt, everything was strapped 
'Til my homey asked, ""What's up with that?"" 
The that was like dis G, I told him I got busy 
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy 

That was foul, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end 
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in 
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know 
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddy, ten-four",Breaker 1/9,Rap
"Breaker, breaker, one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Extorted your rhymes
MC's should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander-n-chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the frisbee, Digi look Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness

So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore; your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical

To be blunt, the beef was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
""Milk"" the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't wanna move or wanna linger 

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen

If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records, ranks us, with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred, is the word
You wild cards, Jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions, show their Spades
A large flock of MC's, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexus's one on both hand
So I guess them GS's was ambidextrous

Could of sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""

So say my name like Candyman
And I'm a come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya d's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Can you say Chi city",Breathe in Breathe Out,Rap

Brenda's got a Baby
Brenda's got a Baby

[Verse 1]
I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A d**n shame
The girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a junky
Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with the molester, who' sexin' her crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever
He left her and she had the baby solo,
she had it on the bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, the social workers here everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Nas]
Let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Super kids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara]
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Greatest man alive!

[Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and oh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

[Olu Dara]
Greatest man? The great-greatest man alive

[Nas]
Hey, hey, hey, my Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to

[Olu Dara]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge

Therefore I live raw and went to war with the law
My only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin' hops from sellin' tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop, got knocked when I popped the glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight

'Cause we put the guns down and go one round
With the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versitile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh

And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish

We do it, up where, we belong
And Moka Only, always, brings it home
(Moka always brings it home)
Let's do it, up and, keep it on

We built a foundation, brick by brick
Eye for an eye, keep your eyes on this
The shadows move in the strangest forms,
Our music in your ear is like a dangerous storm
And when we perform, it's a whole new arena
We raise the stakes while you follow the leader
This song's a heater, long live the speaker
S&M the name explains the main feature

I'm an abnormal creature with pummelin' action
Feature presentation plus the comin' attraction
Asians, Iranians, all same opinion
Indians, blacks and whites and East Indians
Latins, girls draped in lace and satin
North Van to Venice, T-Dot to Manhattan
All get the picture, it's not quite invitin'
Mad Child's excitin', strike of white lightnin'

If we never did our thing?
Please believe me it's my world
Everybody hear me sing now
If you've never heard of us I'm sorry you ain't hip
Here's another track because we always come equipped
Moka love the ladies and the ladies lovin' Mok'
Ain't no need to argue 'cause we're just so fuckin' dope
Take it with a grain of salt or maybe with your drink
Thankin' Swollen Members 'cause they keep the party crank
Like dang dicky dicky dang dicky dang dang
'Cause we bring it home, put it on, make it this way

I stay low to the ground so I can keep my balance
The element of surprise, the advantage of silence
And all you root beer motherfuckers floatin' around
I pop your top you must be watered down
No fears of the glowin' lights of show biz
Young kids, I'll show you whose show it is
Swollen Members hits hard like Heartbreak Ridge
I put my heart into this, no alternative

That's affirmative, we burn with passion, smashin'
Flashin' on kids too concerned with fashion
Handlin' my business, we last longest
My whole congress, strong as King Kong is
Sledgehammer grammar, thunderbolt jolt
Mad Child what you got under your coat?
Adrenaline pump and I'm swingin' an axe
Swollen Members bring it home while Moka sing on the tracks

"Yeah yeah, what, Terror Squad
From the streets to the jail cell
I mean, my niggaz is facin' death penalties and all that
Charlie Rock el D
Yeah, yeah, this go out to you my nigga, yo, yo

Ain't no solution for this
Since day one I been true to this shit
Often niggaz try to shoot but they miss
I been provin' to hit so you know it's really real

I went from chillin' on the hills to signin' deals worth fitty mil
Self made millionaire status
We all gettin' money but it's funny how mine makes niggaz maddest
Come at us if you ready for war

Whoever you are
Leave you dead in your hall leakin' red on the floor
Better than y'all
Niggaz need to face the facts

Since the days of crack I been blazin' gats, tryin' to raise my stats
Tracin' back, you could find me at a racin' track
Laced in black, bettin' on a horse called Amazin' Jack
Joey Crack's the illest, fully backed my killaz

Hoppin' outta 18 wheelas, like mad gorillas
Niggaz need to calm they nerves when I'm concerned
'Cause if you didn't know by now, you all gone learn

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

I puts it down with Pun
Now all I do is lounge in the sun
Look what I done from the slums, to sportin' 5 thousand and ones
See the ice glitter, I only walk with them nice niggaz

Sheist niggaz that quit it for doin' life niggaz
You had a judge, we came through in the clutch
Fifty fifth ain't no what to do when I came through wit'cha
The Don Polly, you could find me as fresh as Denali

In times probably even marching at a Shaufton rally
I often carry that's the price of fame
Got precise the fame snipe you with the rifle and unlight your brain
It ain't a game, it's real niggaz with real guns

That still run, caught a box and pump ox by the millions
Before the children that's confusin' life
The voodoo type that'll pull out the Uzi and make you lose your life
The news is tight, I got 'em hangin' by the neck
Man you tanglin' with vets when you bangin' with TS
(What, what the f*ck)

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

Breaker breaker, send you to the undertaker
The rapper that's comin to take ya 
Cause I shake ya like a Laker
Whether knockin boots, shootin hoops, alley hoops
Ali Dee's hoop funk follow your nose for these here Fruit Loops
You bite like bats if you heard me rap
Drop somethin fat on a track and take on thirty cats, you dirty rats
So here we go, yell Geronimo
Then pass up a hiney, yo
The flow will make you feel like a tiny hoe
I grand-slam like I'm Van Damme
Act like a lumberjack, in fact the track will slam like a Rams fan
You suck so much you need a nipple
I squeeze a trigger, squeeze a Charmin and I cripple Mr. Whipple
And triple any rapper runnin his trapper tryin to kick it 
Pull a pump out on a chump and make him jump like Jiminy Cricket
Flippin it like a page until the damn stage is torn
So bring it on, kid, bring it on

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2: cool G Rap ]
Send in the fire engines cause G Rap is startin fires
Rappers are jumpin like Evil Knievel
You better believe it, I'm comin like Michael Myers
So run and go hide as I get rid of the ones that hid
But on the lid what I did was, ""Yo honey, I blew up the kids""
My broom's not singin the blues, so bring on the crews that try to do me
I'm skimpy like ?Kimpy?, snappy like Daffy and yahoowee!
See, I disrespects em, indeed I disrespect her
Your damn Sam Goody's record makes me laugh like Woody Pecker
Got price on hot mics so your spotlights are dimmin
Lyrics are fatter than women's that you see with Richard Simmons
So back up, don't act up, just be on some good behaviour
You thought it was Lifesavers, the flavor I just gave ya
In fact I pack a disco, my lyrics are slicker than Crisco
Give thrills from Blueberry Hill down to the streets of San Franscico
Like Tabasco I'm hot, if I want to get ripple go sip on a Cisco
You hookey-playin rookies like they cookies from Nabisco
I shake it, I bake it, I take it to the break of, break of dawn
So bring it on, sucker, bring it on

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3: Ali Dee ]
I make examples out of suckers that I trample
Givin plenty lumps to them chumps, I'm a champ
Here's a sample, I catch flashbacks while I smash tracks
Then I blast stacks of wack and sad sack rappers get your ass waxed
Frontin get you nothin but a coffin
I bother your father and bring the drama to your mama, make your ass an orphan
I put some lead inside your head, you're dead and gone
So bring it on, trooper, bring it on

If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you want to rock the ice, and your style is tight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

It's the, rap spectacular, cardiovascular
You see these lyrics they gonna laugh at ya
You want to take it to the streets movin backwards
Straight up and down, you get slapped up like Cassius
And if they want holes hook 'em with a catheter
Mental manipulation like Blackula
Controllin forces knockin soldiers off their horses
Whether the Benz or the Rolls Royce's
Ain't nothin close to kilometer Testa Rosa
Body barometer, pop just like a toaster
I heat and freeze it off simultaneously
Instantaneously, ain't no one worthy but me
I hold my head like a sire for a second
The state of hip hop in my head went through blizzards
Now I hokus pokus regain my focus
I got to keep it movin move smoother than Braggadocios

If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop a slug, gimme a clue
If you want to shock the sights, and you're outta sight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

Inferable, impenetrable, mineral, serial
Spiritual, visuals, sprinkle mics with my lyricals
I use astrophysics and aeronautics
Biologically technical unpointed message view
The type to snatch danger right out your passage view
I bring it back to the essence was
Exodus, want to get next to us
Honeys doin doobies, but the booties gettin rushed

If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop the bubb', gimme a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

You got beef that I'm a stomp with this, bombs I launch wit this
Peep the flames from my orifice, I'm off wit this
Betta call your boss for this, I'm squashin 'em, you
ain't goin far my friend
Insatiable unstoppable, syllable, module
It's logical the diabolical after my molecules
I had to enhance my thought pharmaceuticals
Lyrics is literal paintin pictures daily rituals
I like to free verse from coast to coast
On boats and boast, files be dope and dope
Open scopes, Afu is like hope on a rope
Goin for broke, I make sing somethin I wrote

[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can to
If you want to pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

If you want to pop a slug, give me a clue
If you want to rock the ice, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
Peep this modern day follow through, nothin will boggle you
Suggest I hit them with the darts, now they jiggle too
Now ladies taste a lick, and lick the lyrical liquor
Takin a swigger, checkin her figure, countin her figga's
Some roll through on that real type Perrelli 'ish
Some roll through on that meet me at the telli 'ish
Evidently, evidence stains for centuries
I carve my name in your head like I'm a memory
I'm composin with the Beethoven slogan
Year 3000 on the run like I'm Logan
Change the gases, switch my anti matter
You see I spent about ten life times as a rapper

So what you eatin

Be self defeatin
Sick n tired of bein sick
And tired of bein beaten
Saw em drop it like it
Was way too hot and too fast
For hip hop doo wop rock or bop
Ain't here to hurt you
Don't hang in them circles

What you under a rock?

The next one is wack

They say the youth don't matter
And the old don't mind
It takes a lotta spine
To build all them young minds

Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what? we just makin one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big shot to claim some rocks and shine
Signs of a soul gone solo
Robbed blind
A very small part of half the worlds crime
Runaway child blown by an old land mine
Little ones workin in diamond mines

So cats can say what's hers and what's mine
Diamonds is girls best friend
So whys he cryin

See when y'all hear it get near it
And you recognize the lyrics
You trained to refrain
And you start to fear it

F*ck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it

I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Had the world stepping

I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy

The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh
My enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell
Though an army may encamp against me
My heart shall not fear
Though war may rise against me

I will survive

Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)

Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me
It's like this pain is takin' control of me
Every move I make, determines my fate
Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate
The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors
The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge
When the records stop sellin'
And the crowds stop yellin'
All I have is me

Bet you thought I'd die without you
But see how I'm still living
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one
Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble
Torn apart, a young woman scorned
Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane
In the hospital, crying in the pain
All types of medications, flowing through my veins

Take, these broken wings (these, broken, wings)

And let them live so free

Please, understand I'm a human first
And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga
And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all
Even when I nearly lost my mind
Some remained loyal, ignored the headlines and

Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

That you don't fall in love overnight
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right, oh

I was saying to love 'good-bye'

Taught his son how to snipe cats like Lee Harvey

On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM?
From the Clan that taught you cats Cash Rules
I make slow grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe

Put down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft 
'Cause life ain't a TV screen 
Bullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen 
And the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup 
Sit back, relax as I sketch up 
The scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night 
It was a great fight to me 
I was just an innocent bystander 
Let me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a 
Brother a big fat stick 
Well it was that, or get his black ass kicked 
See, it was five against one 
But this brother was too proud to run 
So he stood in like a trooper

"Brooklyn!
Brooklyn!

Real cool 'cause Brooklyn's cool!
Friday doin' the last day of school
Girls steppin' to the mall to swing
Settin' up dollars for their summer fling
Cars on the avenue create gridlock
And there's girls like MAD at the bus stop
Not waitin' on the bus, but waitin' on the cash flow
Fellas are laughin', gassin' the past hoe
Girl steps to me and pushes issue
That knot you got, is that money or tissue?
Feelin' on the bulge, thinkin' it's her own
I tell her that it's money and she should move on
She says she's pure from legs to her thighs
And we should talk over some Chinese and fries
I tell her to step, but hey that's the scene
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a Brooklyn Queen

[Chorus: x2]
We are looking for 'Brooklyn'
We are looking for the Brooklyn-Queens!

State the rhyme, borough of Brooklyn
Otherwise known as Crooklyn
Freaks fortify flesh with gold
Ears hang trunk, in a slave hold
Walk past, don't get the time of day
Played like suede, on a summer sway
Conversated, till I made her laugh
Said, ""I'm Pete Nice, you want my autograph?""
Oval Office closed as she heard this
She said, ""From third Bass?  I could do this""
Listen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants
'Cause the Brooklyn Queen's a gold digger

[Chorus: x2]

Squared away with my digits and tonight's plans
When I feel a crab grab my right hand
Slapped her on the back, tried to calm her
Asking her, ""Now what's the reason for the drama?""
Her next move was straight out of textbook
""Haven't we met before?""  Giving me a sex look
Yo Wisdom, your lyrics are in bad taste
So I'm forced to give you nothing but the Gas Face
You better go, for hoppin' on the cab or bus
'Cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous
But get this, ain't this a humdinger?
She stepped to a retard sportin' a four-finger ring
Somewhere in the skin tight jeans
I'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens

[Chorus]

Last exit to Brooklyn I enter
Carefully the Queen holds my scepter
Gettin' numb like a Derelict on scotch
I'm Dick Lewis, cause baby I'm watchin' you
scheme on a brother for a knot
To choose between the have and the have-not
Do you doubt the shade of vanilla?
I'll play Elvis and you play Priscilla
Oh he's no hero, better yet Billy Dee
Advertise cheap liquor for a fee
A Brooklyn Queen, rushes Russell Simmons
That's like Tyson rushin' Givens

The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger

I'm like the name Heavy D, I sound fat 
Word for word, line for line, uh

If rap was made by (?) then redeemed because 
You ain't got no ice cream 
So take a seat in the rear 
Don't dare to compare, cause I swear, you gets nothin here 
The way you see me knock out the next brother 
You'd think my moms had a talk with LL's mother, huh

Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea 
Knock the boots on a girl named Althea

When I grab the microphone and shout 
You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out 
I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit em with one of the rhymes 
I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash 
Run for shelter, no one can help ya 
You pushed up on a heavyweight, 
When your rhymes are welterweight that's right, 
Wait, because you're not fitted 
You're never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
Uhh, I'm what you call a rap legend 
And definitely the last MC to be present 
Don't even try to take mines 
You fuckin new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes

U Can't Touch This, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this 
I'm like Steven Segall, ""Out for Justice""
As for competition, pssh, what's this? 
You're not prepared to, rappers are scared too 
Confront this, 'cause you know damn well you don't want this 
Some good advice is just break out 
Before I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out 
As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that 
Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that

"[ VERSE 1 ]
Brothers ain't shit
They're lookin for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pullin your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Steady schemin on how they want to stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin crack
Go home and go to bed, son
You're just comin from the barbershop and tryin to get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not havin you
Player, go around tellin other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while you're shoppin
Their girl's not around, so they're goin hoe-hoppin
>From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryin to kick it to your mother
Stop smilin, I know all you want to do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad, cause I always look serious
So they slam on my muthafuckin period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny?
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants you can't get into
Matter of fact, I'm tooken
So you brothers in the jeep can keep lookin, but I ain't hookin
Yes, I'm givin you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word, cause brothers ain't shit

[ VERSE  2 ]
I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue Benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin about (Yo, y'all got some real fat asses)
I kept walkin, Tracy stopped and started talkin
With all these muthafuckas hawkin 
With that dumb-lookin grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carryin three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well, that's how they planned it
She didn't want to screw, so they left her ass stranded
That's what she gets for wildin
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precint
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you want to grab it
I get approached by a man, sometimes I throw a fit
Word, cause brothers ain't shit

[ VERSE 3 ]
Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn, keep rollin
No, I don't want to ride, cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a 'gas, grass or ass'-sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothin that will make my rep fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
F*ck the rest of us
Niggas keep testin us
A man could make you want to kill him
Or late at night make you want to thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat, and you want to know why?
That's the dog in him - woof, woof!
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'poof!'
You say, ""Yo, yo, where you goin?""
He's cheatin and he's skeezin and you're not even knowin
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the thing, and they make you go ""Whoo...""
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house? Here's what you do
You should do some voodoo
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why? Cause brothers ain't shit",Brothers Ain't Shit,Rap

It was a Sunday afternoon
When I laid eyes on you
Could it be true
I knew I had to have you
I had to keep to myself
The feelings that I feel for you
Cause baby you know

As you're talking to me
It seems I could not look away
I told myself don't fight it, no
Your eyes told me to stay here baby

That's not like me, no

"[Bubba Sparxxx]
I can't do that Timbaland shit, that that shoop shit..

There goes that damn Bubba just bein his country self
Slide inside Timmy's track and ride it 'til nothing's left
Bet you then they'll get the picture, a legendary mixture
like Jim Beam and Coke, can you cope with that elixir?
Drank it, that'll fix ya, why you angry anyway?
I'm in the same mud as you, been dirty for plenty days
Okay, let's get it on, in any shape form or fashion
At the Tunnel in New York, or at the dorms out in Athens
y'all still don't hear me?  Am I not speakin clearly?
I just throw y'all little lames on any trash heap that's near me
F*ck 'em, hot damn 'em, really, to hell with 'em
Send 'em to Nelly B(?), and certainly they'll get 'em
I really don't have to answer to questions that y'all present me
But I know why after this here session, y'all resent me
Never the one to fuss, just smile and let 'em walk
Okey-dokey, now they knowin how Bubba talk

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey, dis dat Bubba talk
y'all don't know me a'tall
I say the same thang but slower than y'all
A little Southern charm to top it off
Okey-dokey - SPIT BOY!

[Bubba Sparxxx]
This time it gets ugly, my folks done got to drankin
Some rednecks and thugs in the club, now what you thankin?
Hopped up and stankin, bankin on Bubba's rise
All up on that Betty you got, with rubber thighs
Can't help but love them guys, they happy they out the country
But the country's still in them, black and nappy, white and grungy
Lawd this boy's gone, from dirty to fast speed
And if she don't visit, we snatchin that rare squeeze
If you mad leave, this is not yo' type of party
Some Jim Beam with gin and Henn with white Bacardi
Yeah we quite retarded but hell you only live once
Still talkin Bubba but I can't complete the sentence

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I slowly let my anger turn to just concern
for y'alls well bein, I'm seein there's much to earn
In this money pit of music, this dummy shit's amusin
That's what you think it is?  Meet me at the bank with this
I'll withdraw the same two bills and spend it on port (?)
y'all can't run with me, stay on the porch please
There's somethin special, about Bubba's mannerisms
That's why they should accept, any helpin hand I give 'em
I don't know, is it me, or is this industry foul?
They used to be sugar but they shit to me now
Get in and get bent, that's enough then cut me off
No matter what it cost it's worth it when Bubba talk

Mami all on me cause I'm touchin' her belly
I'm on butter pirelli's
Wit' purple and yellow, hello
That's butter and jelly
I flip butter on celly's
All right in front of the deli
Holly, lilly, to kelly all spent once on the telly
(and what else) and I got hella gear
My earring is nice the price
3 townhomes in delaware
Uh tomato porsche lookin' like tomato sauce
Hip hop hooray I got to get
That yayo off
That's blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the 
Ave, I put the glock in the stash, slabs and copped in the trash
Still stop and I laugh, ma put
Them rock in your ass, the rest twat in ya bag, dag, hop in a cab
Play you for what
You gon' play yourself
Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself
And my weight of the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday dog 
Don't play with your health.

Mami...she open she open,jump off...hopin' I'm hopin', grab her...rope em' and dope em',
Oral...choke em' and choke em'
I flip bundle to bundle, tryin' to double my double, at the same time.....for what.....but
The cops say I'm 

[verse 2]
I get fresh from
Yankee stadium to the garden I beg your pardon
Stop it, my closet, macy's mens department
Pants, shirt, scarf, phone if you check it
Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section
Fur for fur baby, baby you'll go stir crazy
Got that david yurmen burnin', the bird gazey
You'll get hurt play me
Burp let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately I know
Some rn's that still strip, when I and this real dick, in
The clinic, no student can heal shit
Better than college, after that, students home
At least after your bid, ain't no student loans
To pay back, jack, ask 
What do you condone
Hit towns wit coke, a .45 blue as chrome
Now they done juiced marone??
Knock, knock are you at home
I'm a call he, girls call the crib 
And ask are you alone

We race foreign cars, customed models, drop top mustard tahoe
We like the musketeers, trained by cus d'amato
Just a model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow
Watch sanford in son
I'm like the buzz in rolo
Afourtuniado, the porsche apollo, wars a follow
Got the mack jack, still swing swords like zorro
We jackin' and clappin' y'all just applaud like bravo
Now I plaud the cappo, zeke and santana
I don't razor wrist's
I keep eighths of piff
The games and the chick
Like kobe imma rape the bitch
Razor grips, laser spit, glock cocked j or fifth
D on the block just like jadakiss
Haters shift, plead the fifth, spray

Who I'm is? We ain't got shit, something got to give
Y'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze
Looking at your ice like GEEZ!
I'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at? Wu, til they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke, let it be
Ain't nothing nice in, New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing
That tough talk? Don't mean nothing when you're up North
So keep them hands where I can see em like you want freedom
You know that saying, if you can't join 'em, beat 'em
And push your way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slums usually Jacob, FOOL!
You're like, ""Dude! I don't like your fuckin attitude
Frontin on my Clan from the Stat' when we ain't mad at you""

Yo, yo
Starks flipping cheesy face measly paced o'face
Ghostface, jump out the window for a little taste
The joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, ""Ghost you so crazy!""

""There's no love to be found""

Cappa' slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jewels, big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose
It's the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home, Staten Island
Playing with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dustheads runnin (yo)
The rap kingpin bust the Black Jesus is comin

Yo
The words you talk, that'll be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets, flying)
Yo, the hard wire, starting barn fires
Pulling mad, so you know it's me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya

Eat a dick like
Baby shake your shit, girl you're thick like
Getting rich like

""There's no love to be found""

Word it's me y'all
We in two-six's flirting with bitches
Dime plus taking pictures, how you doing baby? My name Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains, or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga going since ""Grease""
Check out the grays on the side of my waves
I grew those on Riker's Island
Stretched out, balled up in the caves
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versace's, snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic, funeral love
Moving when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks, come back all chiseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghettofabulous, Ton' Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's
I start my own chapters
Tyco nightglow velvet pose, special effects
High-tech armors merc you at the shows

Dociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper
Cancun, catch me in the room, eating grouper

Shoe fly shoo, Wally Don Clark crew
F*ck y'all want to do? Crack a brew, smoke an L or two
And flip like

F*ck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts
But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts
Word to the shell around my chest
Big up to all de massive rude boy up on deck
So if you see a weak nigga speak to that bastard

And a nickel bag of weed, yes indeed

Fly as hell, hit the park play the wall
And all the older people sayin' Shorty's a bad-ass
But you's a smart little nigga so you gonna last

You know what I'm sayin'? Buckshot Shorty
Five F-T, my DJ Evil Dee
Mr. Walt, all my niggaz in the motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin'? Smokin' mad blunts
And just chillin' so buck down the bullshit in ninety-three
Ninety-four, ninety-five, shit is ours

"Verse 1: 
Yo  Yo  Aye Yo! 
I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace  selling reefer 
Puffing a challis with the beef eaters. 
Gettin' so high that whenever I drop shit 
It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit. 
Canibus with the hot shit  ""Crazy I. Click"" 
Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin' that they can stop this. 
I'll increase my strength  to a super human extent 
Nigga your rhyme ain't worth six pence. 
And if you can hear, smell, see, touch, and taste.... 
Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face. 
>From Princeton, to ????? my lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin, 
And murder niggas for rhymin'. Spittin fire.... 
With gasoline filled saliva, drunk as Lady Diana's driver with 
reporters 
Behind her. Alcohol in the hands of 
A minor. I got you panicking like bombs, with 30 second timers. 
Clear the building, evacuate women and children.... 
F*ck what you feelin' nigga I came here to kill 'em. 
Straight shittin', from New York to Great Britain, 
And when we do shows we make the queen pay admission 
What! 
Chorus: 
Canibus: When I say ""Can-I"" you say ""Bus"" 
Canibus: Can-I

Canibus: Can-I

Canibus: When I say ""Can-I"" you say ""Bus"" 
Canibus: Can-I

Verse 2: 
Yo, Yo 
Prepare for the worst. This next verse is the face of death 
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex, 
Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic 
With more flavor then skittles when not digitally mastered. 
I go off like a cannon, and blow up the planet with ""No Fear"" 
Like them clothes white boys be wearing. 
I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites 
The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights. 
There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that. 
There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback. 
I'm strong my word is ""Bond"" like James, 
Niggas be tryin' to test but they ""week"" like 7 days. 
MC's run away when I kick it, they act so chicken 
They should come with a large drink and a biscuit. 
My styles radioactive, massive atomic, I plan to push the Earth 
In Front of Haley's comet. Breaking the ""Facts Of Life"" down 
Like Tudy, I'm raw like sushi, with more vocab, then 
Three fucking Fugees. So recognize or be hospitalized 
Because lyrically on a scale of 1-10 I'm 25! 
Chorus: 
Verse 3: 
Yo, Yo, 
A little bit of weed and some hennesy, 
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy. 
See I need much more energy then my enemies 
If I want to make more Bill's then Bellamy. 
So I could be on MTV, with women constantly telling me, 
I resemble Billy D. I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene. 
And when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green. 
Then I take the green by a automobile machine, for 
That thing on page 43, in Jet Magazine. 
Canibus is the ultimate executioner's dream. Swinging the guillotine. 
'cause whenever the head is severed from the human body 
With a sharp enough weapon, the brain remains conscious for 10 
seconds. 
Long enough for me to give you one last message, 
And when you get to hell you can tell Lucifer I said it. 
Don't ever get it confused. Fuckin' with Canibus the human ""rubics 
cube"" 
Like you got something to prove. 
Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me'll get booed, and get everything 
In the club thrown at you and your crew. 
>From moette bottles to bar stools, fruits and foods, if you got a 
album 
Out you get hit with your CD too. 
Runnin' outside, lying, crying, denying that you ain't 
The Gay Rapper, but you got fucked by him. 
What's the difference, ya'll niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness. 
Too busy mixing your business, with your bitches 
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures 
So wicked, I Satan ejaculating on his fingers 
Like Dirk Diggler, in the middle of Boogie Nights 
Sniffin' white livin' the hype, he ruined his life. 
But I'm a MC of a different type, yeah that's right. 
Make sure your shit is right, or I'm a snatch your mic.

"Dieses Haus ist besetzt ohne Pause bis jetzt
Denn wir kamen zuerst und wir gehen auch zuletzt
Buenos Dias Messias auch wenn's dir nicht paßt
Do bist nur Gast hier do faßt hier nichts an
Bei einigen leidigen Themen lehnen wir's Reden ab
Und leider gibt's nicht viel das noch nicht gesuckt hat
Nicht nach kurzem beknackt war wie der Pappstar der zu matt war
Um mehr zu sein als Jingle zu seinem Abziehbild
Oder ein paar Singles hinter'm Namensschild
Doch ich weiß Image ist nichts und scheiß auf alle die bekannt sind
I'm Land sind zu viele Promis die nicht bei Verstand sind
Zu viele Homies die noch nicht am Strand sind am Rand sind
Zu viele Gaffer deren Augenblicke so leersie wollen noch mehr Helden fallen sehen alle Denker lallen sehen
Ich seh sie schon als Wanker in Museenhallen stehn
Sie werden kommen und gehen alles nur Gesichter
I'm Zeitgeschehen der Club der toten Dichter stimmt mich nicht versöhnlich
Ich werde weitergehen und lebe lieber ungewöhnlich
Denn das hier geht alle unsere Widersacher Wichtigmacher
Cocksucker Motherfucker Hosenkacker
Aalglatte nimmersatte Jammerlappen die wie Ratten in Kloaken
Darauf warten über unsere Platten zu beraten ha
Ihr ganzen Abklemmer Flachwanker Spartendenker
Wir sind eure Rattenfänger autonome Einzelgänger
Weil wir länger halten als der Typ I'm Sarkophag
Während ihr Idioten euer eigenes Grab grabt
Dieses Haus ist besetzt...
Denn wenn ich dir in deiner Welt nichts sagen kann
Wozu dann all diese Fragen Mann
Anscheinend interessiert es dich ja doch was der Typ so treibt
Und wem er was macht und wo er bleibt
Das sowas Mitgefühl ist glaub ich kaum
Ich fürchte fast ich bin dein lebender Alptraum
Müllredender Abschaum der dich ständig disst
Und dabei sag ich doch nur was do für mich bist
Die ganze Pisse die dein Leben durch meine Venen spült
Verursacht Risse und mein Herz unterkühlt
Doch da meine Liebe wasserdicht und meine Seele kugelsicher
Macht ihr Stricher bei mir keinen Stich mehr
Ich bin euer Richter und Henker ihr Wanker und nach mir kommt nichts mehr
Denn das hier geht...
Dieses Haus ist besetzt...
Staubige Hände mit zerknitterten Karten
Von draußen kommen Fremde die auf's Ende des Gewitters warten
Vom Piano klingt dasselbe Lied wie immer
Und Frauen verkaufen Liebe auf dem Zimmer
Dichter Rauch macht Luft zum Schneiden dick
Mit einem Seitenblick erkenn dich I'm Dämmerlicht
Und was ich seh ist jämmerlich falscher Platz falsche Zeit
Diese Stadt ist zu klein für uns zwei
Der Himmel weint kein Mensch weit und breit
Zwanzig Schritte entfernt trennt dich von mir die Ewigkeit
Während ich dir in die Augen schaue merke ich do ziehst
Höre wie do schießt bleib noch stehen und sehe dir zu
Wie do sie dann für immer schließt

""And then I..""

[Ed O.G.]
Now this is the meanin of a Bug-A-Boo
It's a person who's constantly BUGGIN YOU
Never givin you no room TO BREATHE
On you like skin, or a shirt WITH SLEEVES
A person that constantly wants to be around you
It could even be your moms or pops when they hound you
Just someone who's always botherin you
If you was a plant, they'd be continuously waterin you
Sweatin you like - heat
Let's say you are the (?), and they are the sheets
Always on you, and wrapped around you
As if you were lost, and they just found you
They never get the picture
No matter how many times you diss 'em, they still want to get witcha
continuously callin never givin you a rest
A Bug-A-Boo's just like a fly..
Nothing but a pest, and I suggest
That you step, why?

[Chorus]
Cause you're a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo..

[Ed O.G.]
Now girls, there's that certain guy that just be tippin
On you like clothes and I suppose that you be dippin
in his kicks, cause he's a stupid dick
Sappy givin you this and that, so you can feel happy
Yeah you might be happy but you're sick of him
Because he's on it, and you want to get rid of him
But he's sweatin you, don't knock it cause he's gettin you
everything you want, so you can get fly
You say, ""Bug-A-Boo jump,"" and he says, ""How high?""
Hey, just get paid, cause he's payin you
And don't call him by his name, call him a Bug-A-Boo

[Chorus]

[Ed O.G.]
Now everybody knows a Bug-A-Boo or was a Bug-A-Boo
You mighta had to bug a few or even fell in love and knew
that you was buggin a person, never cuttin no slack
Cause everytime you called them they was like ""I'll call you back""
Now a girl can whip a guy, and he can become one
He'll be callin you'll be stallin cause he's stupid a dumb one
But it goes both ways, and as a matter of fact
A girl can catch her man cheatin, and still take him back
So to all you Bug-A-Boos who got the blues and really want it
without you Bug-A-Boos we couldn't say that you were on it

Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP

If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley

Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it

But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
F*ck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, f*ck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle

"Yo, microphone check one two what is this
The five foot assassin with the ruffneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family

No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You want to diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half

I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Messing round with this you catch  the sizing of em?
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper

Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you Seckle With the Mission
I never walk the streets, think it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be

I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers that's creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape

The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
Point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt

Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work,
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smoking R&B cause they try to do me

Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug

On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

Buggin' out you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out,
Buggin' out you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out,

Buggin' out, buggin' out,
Buggin' out you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out,
Buggin' out you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding

You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
'Comafied' your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind

Oh yo he's acting stank, really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you want to but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks

Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying, mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

Yo, I am not an invalid although I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on the real hardest so we can have the big fun

When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me

Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did

Supposed to be my man but now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongest and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Buggin' out, buggin' out,
Buggin' out you're buggin' out

Oh I'd lie for you baby
Oh I'd die for you baby

I build you up
But if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me you'll be around
Hold me down
I'll build you up

Listen if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
Its a secret I want the world to know that you're mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writin' a song, instead of a love letter
They can play it on the radio, a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it, you would stop and think of me
I want to get to know ya and be the reason you smile
Girl, you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times are tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them
If so, I'll see to it that they always around
Nothin' but the best now, how does that sound
If I talk with you, when we talk you can keep it
Girl, you on my mind all the time, its a secret

Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine

Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure

I think about you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Was it just my imagination again runnin' away
If you ready to ride girl come on let's roll
G-55 fly ma let's go
Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my present
Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
We can shop a lil' bit, I pick out my shit
One pair at a time, till your shoe games sick
Now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably
For better or worst, like Whitney and Bobby
If you want to play house, we can play house then
But wait why pretend if you can move in
Before I be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend
Girl, its more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
'Cause I know with you by my side, there's nothin' I can't do

Baby I'll build you up

"It's time to separate the rookies from vets
Pussies from threats, truth from lies
Supplies from dealers and death
I'm feelin' this, I'm young and ruthless
Status unmatched, undisputed, some assuming
My destiny to rep these streets

I'm built for this, the will is too strong
Feeling's numb from dealing too long
It's real count ya friends when you on
My pen is visual, I'm real, men are miserable
I feel the tension growing, you hold a grudge
A 45 with infra holding no love
Hungry like my ribs are showin', as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut, raw, my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark, I tear you open, cut you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles

When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like medusa stair, I'm so lethal
Obviously, I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace, it's hard to stick me
I'm built for this, in the street, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist 'cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak, I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectance
My essence is gettin' money, my aura like Lexus

On the mic I'm relentlence, pursue the perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw, what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me

I doubt the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper
Son, we nearly extinct
I realized that when buried Spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent

M for the man, E executioner
G get money, A all my niggas movin' up
I'm built for this, for real it's in me
Like RK, I make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer empties semi-auto
I conceal on these streets that to uphold the kiss of death
Tryin' to deal ki's and snort blow, you can't replace me

I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weigh coke on scales that's digitalized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize, the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth",Built For This,Rap
"We built this city
We built this city
We built this city
We built this city on rock

We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

If not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling
Cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling

(We built this city) Cradle to 50, yeah I'm acting real seditty

"Giunse il freddo fra le volte di una notte stellata
Una roccia sventrata nel buio stentava
Onda cupa su una curva di una duna spezzata
E là qualcuno aspettava, ed intanto pensava:
""Maledetta questa notte, la sua mano fredda
Questa luna splende forte vuole la mia testa
Adesso tocca a me, me, adesso tocca a me, me
L'aria cupa qua brucia sotto i colpi di Katiuscia""
Ma il cielo oscura le nubi con le sue fauci e sfila
Lame di luce racchiuse nei campi glauchi
Fuma fumi dai buchi tra fulmini e lampi bianchi
Sfondi dipinti a tratti, uomini vinti a traumi
Mangia luce sulle strade, l'inverno fra queste terre
Le cartucce ghiacciate all'interno delle giberne
Noi spettri nel corpo fra i resti dei kolchoz
E il cielo piange pece fra neve macerie e cenere
Freddo nella testa acquattato con un'idea
Lo scatto della mia destra col ghiaccio nella trachea
Qua vedetta di guerra, qui in terra di steppa
Fermo sulla testa il quadrato di Cassiopea

Qua la notte muta, il capo china
Io nascosto nella coltre guardo l'altra linea
Salta un'altra mina, sotto un'altra fila
E alla fine di stanotte ti dirò, ti dirò chi sei
Qua la notte muta, il capo china
Io nascosto nella coltre fino all'alba prima
Prendo un'altra mira, salta un'altra vita
E alla fine di stanotte ti dirò, chiederò, ""ci sei?""

Io qua solo dentro ad un bunker
Fermo in punta da un mese
Per ore a guardare il buio che trapunta la neve
Ieri un'altra vedetta è morta con tre buchi in testa
Mentre stanno maturando i sambuchi nel suo paese
Qua altra sorte, marcia il gelo, neve rossa
Mille colpi sul terreno, schiena rotta, neve in bocca
E sento ancora l'ombra, la voce nascosta
Che parla dei ricordi tra i suoi colli di Marostica
""Spero dopo tutto questo tu riceverai i miei diari
Anche solo questo elmetto dove pianterai i gerani""
Nascosti qui in trecento, avamposto del nulla
Sta folla trema al vento, è una foglia di betulla
Tra steppe di campi e neve, tra i pezzi di un Panzer nero
Con gli occhi intrecciati al buio, fra tetti di fango e gelo
Qua proiettili a mantello che sferzano mezzi in ferro
Qua pezzi di parabellum che spezzano i nervi al cielo

Qua la notte muta, il capo china
Io nascosto nella coltre guardo l'altra linea
Salta un'altra mina, sotto un'altra fila
E alla fine di stanotte ti dirò, ti dirò chi sei
Qua la notte muta, il capo china
Io nascosto nella coltre fino all'alba prima
Prendo un'altra mira, salta un'altra vita
E alla fine di stanotte ti dirò, chiederò, ""ci sei?""

Ora che è finito tutto, baciato dalla fortuna
Qua ogni notte chiudo gli occhi e rivedo quella pianura
I corpi, la notte buia, li tocco, gli chiedo scusa
E negli occhi di quei morti ritrovo la mia paura
Gambe in spalla col sorriso di chi torna
Torno a casa, la speranza è ancora viva nella cornea
Lei vede il dopoguerra, qua l'erba germoglia
E il sole non mi afferra, non rende più l'ombra
Ora che ritorno al borgo, scorgo gli orti dei ricordi
Ci ritrovo la mia casa, sera tardi e campi d'orzo
E qua nessuno mi saluta, non mi parla, non mi chiede
Qui chi passa non mi crede e chi mi guarda non mi vede
La mia gente non mi segue che se parlo non mi sente
E anche tu che mi aspettavi, passi con lo sguardo assente
Che tu che ti aspettavi, hai pianto quando ti specchiavi
Tanto tempo spezza le ali a un amore trasparente
Risucchiato nella notte ora muoio veramente
Il soldato nella coltre vola via nella corrente
La mia morte è nella mente che dimentica per sempre
La morte è nella gente che dimentica chi perde

Qua la sorte non ci celebra
La morte giunge gelida
Genera le fosse
Qua tenebra è la notte
Celebra ma non genera
Gelida, tenebra
E qua la sorte non ci celebra
Ma genera le fosse
La morte giunge gelida
Qua tenebra è la notte
Notte, notte, notte, notte",Buio,Rap
"Yesterday I was sitting. recalling. reminiscing
Trying to remember whenever there was nobody listening
Before the hugging and the kissing, the booing and the hissing
All I had was just a vision,
All I had was my ambition
Your love without condition
Kept me swinging when I'm missing
My eyes upon the prize
Kept me striving for the mission
When I was down for the count, falling out of commission
I can hear you voice now screaming out ""son, listen""
Get on up, don't give up, though you struck opposition
Time to buck all that stuff, find out what's you condition
Like a pull in my soul, like keys in my ignition
Call you all my commission, my love and my vision and

It doesn't matter if they call me wrong
Doesn't matter if they steal my song
Doesn't matter if we're all alone
It doesn't matter at all

'Cause I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea
I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall
To show you it's for real

Remember when we used to flow together back in the park
You would slang guitar licks under the stars in the dark
You'd say let's grow together as this world falls apart
I was holding on to hope but hardly holding a spark
All the rhymes that I wrote you'd call dope from the start
I'd be like a pure note. like a quote on the mark
You'd go to every show and promote from the start
From the beginning we've been building much more than this art
Remember bearing scars in you car to impart you heart
You cared enough to call my bluff through the junk from the start
That's why you're holding onto half of my heart
You've been there through the times,
Through the nights that were dark and

It doesn't matter if they call me wrong
Doesn't matter if they steal my song
Doesn't matter if we're all alone

I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall

I would take a bullet for you

Cleveland, open up ya' doors

I'm in the old school '84 Delta 88
Wit' a ounce but I'm bouncin' like I'm out here movin' weight
Bumpin Biggie in the pioneer as I reminisce
Before that it was Devils took 'em back to '96

I went down to Houston for some face
Mary Jane wit' a coincidence I'm blowin' swishas doin the same thing
Six-hundred for some big O's, 400 degrees
I'm a ho, Playaz Club, Ice Cube, Master P

And since I'm movin' my yay, know I got UGK
Ridin' dirty lookin' for that high life pimp what more can I say?
I'm just stickin' and movin', under my seat is my tool
And I keep it for any nigga wanna be trippin' or foolin'

I'm just bumpin' my music as I'm spinnin' the ben
I'm bumpin' Pac, picture me rollin' without spillin' my Hen
Yeah, yeah, now as I spin in the ben
I'm bumpin' Pac picture me rollin' without spillin' my Hen

I'm just bumpin' my music, music, music
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well, let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow

Now back to the '84 big body to door
No blaze on the muhfucka but it still roll
Memba' what told you what I had stashed in the dash
Back in the past, well, now I got two O's

Ricky tells, two show, comin' out hard
Doors wide open, kids dancin' in the yard
While I'm stuntin' like Evel Knievel man
Bumpin' Cutlass, Monte Carlos and Rivas man

Rollin' in slow mo, like the whole block screwed
Like bill '79, bumpin' Devin the Dude
On the way to the telly, we was bumpin' R. Kelly
And right before I cut her, it was confessions from Usher

She ain't used to a thug, she love the way I ride
While I'm bumpin' My Life by Mary J. Blige
See I damn near cried day Rick James died
See that shit was cold blooded but the music keep pumpin'

I'm just bumpin' my music, music, music
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well, let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow

Hey, I like that shit you on, ya dig?
And I got some shit I'ma put you on
I'ma put you on that shit I be on

It was like f*ck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga blowin' Big comin' down
A nigga with the attitude easy re-in' Dre and Q
Creepin' up the avenue, that's how you had to do

Yes, I'm the rhythm, the rebel without a cause
Never lowerin' my level
I'm on some Chuck D shit from PE
Six in the mornin' I hustle with Ice T

Six in the evenin' I'm chillin' wit' Willy be
Leavin' out the nickel I'm bumpin' some cool G. Rap
Back to the neighborhood, shoot me some craps
I'm fuckin' wit' that pluck wit' the cool aid pack

And now I got a brotha by the name of Warren Lee
Hot shot Regal illegal, like Marley
I get down like I'm BDP
Ass blaster like blast faster cocked and squeeze

Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me, I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me

Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'

But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin' real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there bust a move

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really fine cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin' bass is pumpin'
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove

"He's the big boss when his hands criss-cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip-hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

DJ's he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm Kool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
 
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle Kool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco 
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow 
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors:  zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Kool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax

Eh, yo, yo yo
This is Ying Yang Twins with a ghetto public service announcment (uh oh)
Red light (ohh), red light (ohh, ohh)
Stay by yourself, (ohh) by yourself (ohh)...

[Chorus] - 2X
Smoke by myself
Drink by myself
Poke these hoes by my goddamn self, for rrreal (By my goddamn self)
For rrreal (By my goddamn self)

[Verse 1]
Nigga dwell on it, can't he
So tell on me, got my bitch all at the crib
Try to smell on a nigga, want to stay around him
But when I'm sitting on the couch
She keep me saying ""ouch"", 'cause she grabbin on my crouch
And I already know, thinking to myself
What the f*ck, somebody told
Had to have been one little nigga that I showed
Some shit that they never should have seen, anyhow
All hell nigguh...hatin' on me now, smokin' on my weed
Steady drinkin' on my beer, hell naw niggah
Get the f*ck up out of here, can't hold one
So you can't hold your tongue, nigga lips smackin
Like she chew bubble gum, tell her where I been
What I did, who I'm with
Said see me with two bitches, that's when I said it
I gotta stay the f*ck away from head, I'ma

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fuss with nobody else
Now red light, child started a fight
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovas
Shorty, did I stutter? Go get another rubba
Child is shaking like blubba, child that want me to cut her
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out!
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work
I'm hitting the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky
Haven't seen what I've been, I'm drinking all alone
On the phone with my b...l, you, n, t 'course every day
I white out, acamo, philly, or marsailles
Give a f*ck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' 'cause I...

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Smoke by myself, drink byself
Poke by myself, cause I was born by my God damn self
F*ck, run and train, that shit lame
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high
I don't give a f*ck, if ya got fire
Every now and then you chip, and you want to get Henn
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin, don't roll trees
Hey man, shit, take it from me
You better off to get drunk on a Pepsi
Up, that's a beep, might be a freak (Hey lemme roll with your phone?)
I ain't taking nobody with me, I'ma ride by myself
Get high by myself, get drunk by myself
F*ck this ho by my goddamn self (myself)
Don't nobody hold your own, like your own
that's why we on our own...

[Chorus] - 3X

[Outro]
See now when you do what you do, how you do what you do
When you do what you do, nobody can tell on you
If you all by yourself, ah ah ah, say it
I don't need no friends, I don't need no foes
I'ma drink my Henn, and choke all out the door
Now everybody said goodbye, get your hand that burns
It's just good to see ya ride, reverse, reverse
Biieetch, reverse, reverse, biieetch
To wonder all this time, what happened this time? (Hoooo!)
Everybody tries ta, everybody chill...we just playin'
Everybody but me, Ying Yang Twins out for the 2001

Show him the loffs hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right

And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to beâ?¦

"Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money

This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Reminiscing on my first slant,
By the time I was sipping on my first Schlitz
Hit the game, I started as a look out,
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out,
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.
Bottles at the tunnel, that was 98, I called papa for the bundles,
An easy ten grand, it felt like a hundred,
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them.
Its only wealth that we want, if we run wit em
Till the death, until the feds come and get em
Byrd gang money, it started off that Byrd Kane Money
New cars, in that third lane money!

Just clean my fancy car,
Picked up my fancy clothes,
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money
Only real niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

Getting money is the hardest,
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist.
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me I'm the boss in the middle.
The brain and the bran roc-a-house rope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm. Come on man

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money,
This is Byrd gang money,

Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money.

At a young age, no bricks just grams
Nigga stuck, then your mans a flip
The situation real, then your mans a hit
You slow on the get-a-way, the can you get
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed
But you know me forever manning up,
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots,
Big homie, pioneer of the block
You wanna pump, nigga Ill tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight; I'm not the one to stare at.
Matter of fact dog, you and your man sits,
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index
I guess you could, cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled.

Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot,
No, we got the bomb,

"Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamika 'round the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, 'cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' with the sounds bumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut 'til it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

"C'EST PAS MA FAUTE
Mes origines sont floues
Ne me demande pas si j'en ai
Respecte mon silence
Car si je l'ouvre c'est cramé
J'ai pas d'papiers la vérité
Soi-disant né pour servir et protéger
La cruauté des hommes m'a abusé
Oui j'suis un clando
J'ai fais mes classes dans l'Est
À la dure ou des filles trop jeunes
Se vendaient pour mon maître
Sexe, violence j'ai connu que ça
J'ai renvoyé beaucoup d'gens au trépas
Même si j'aimais pas ça
Puis on m'a arrêté, détenu, vendu
On m'a trop souillé
Par toutes sortes d'individus
C'est pas ma faute, ma nature est comme ça
Moi je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force
Je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force
Pourquoi ?
Je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
J'aurai voulu être une arme de fonction
Qu'on me soigne, qu'on m'utilise avec attention
Fréquenter les stands de tirs, le beau monde
Au lieu d'ça j'suis arrivé en France en camion
Dans un carton j'ai vu que ma vie ne serait pas un conte
Saisi comme une merde avec des contrefaçons
Jeté au placard avec d'autres, c'est drôle
Chacun a son histoire aussi dramatiques les unes que les autres
Colle ce calibre 9 mm, jure que la femme de son maître
S'est elle-même tiré dans la tête, puis elle fatiguait le vieux fusil
Qu'a ? un cas jure que c'était une chèvre ou une caille

À son actif au moins vingt à trente victimes
Et on a l'amnésique semi automatique
Trouvé au fond de l'eau dans un état critique
Et le chromé le bourg' qu'a trop traîné dans la poudre
Jure qu'il a des amis en haut lieu
Et qu'son affaire va se résoudre
On est tous là à espérer une sortie
Je rêve de jouer dans un film ou une série
Je voudrais ne plus être un objet qui fait peur

On s'y attendait plus, endormis
Cachés dans un sac, tranquilles
Je sais qu'on allait être achetés à bas prix
Y'a l'fusil qui panique qui veut pas
Faire la guerre en Afrique
Nous c'est la loterie, la loi du trafic
On n'est pas un lot de bijouterie
J'ai pas fini autour du cou
D'un people sous ectasy
Mais dans les mains d'un môme de vingt piges
Jusqu'à cette descente de flics
Où ils m'ont sorti de en dessous du lit
Où j'ai vu mes semblables pointer le p'tit
Ni vi ni connu on m'a mis avec le gib'
J'ai attendu le placard
Mais on m'a vendu à une fille
Elle était pas d'ici
Comme moi étrangère en exil
Et elle m'a plue
Elle était si fragile

Love and unity
Don't worry bout the power we got a generator
And publicity
Batteries for rent you can pay us later

Get your digital watches in synchronization
Producer of the shows got a selfish motivation
It's the place to be and we got a location
Another gold disc for an album compilation

Take a tip from me
In case there's a problem bring identification

"Intro/Chorus:

c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down (4X)

Verse One: El Da Sensai

c'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strollin through the industry be	, see we gotta be
the next shit that kicks, cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids were jealous for the props
See the shit never stops Hobbes, just lookin for my dillz-knot
Styles we make, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notified that, the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of the underground
but they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Two: Tame One

You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggaz who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts of Jersey
Cause brothers be buggin not givin love to the nuccas
Sayin f*ck us, cause we be shinin brighter than the suckers
Shootin me prison nobody listens to your dissin
Cause yo my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin
the high note, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures
Cause now that I rock I got more niggaz on my jock than bitches
I just want to do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source RapPages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin your jaws
I freak techniques, cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks talk junk, Tame and the Sensai leave em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Three: MC El, Tame One

Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
to prove a point, that the niggaz is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition 'cause I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggaz, can't believe the Artifacts achieve
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itchin from the shit that I'm scriptin
So pass the baton, to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin others rock and clock we shocked em like a robot
with our props, so now the Notty Head Niggaz got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy chump, my drunk style is trunky dunk
My disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
'cause I'm comin from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin slept, are dead because we keep on
peepin these weak MC's, who cheese with their bologny
Cause they're phony as f*ck, and couldn't pull shit off a tow truck
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine
Ch-chick-POW! Wu from the gate now

It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

"Well come with me to a place by the sea,
If your ship breaks down, you can always find me,
And Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree,
Our fans are always welcome with our friends and family.

And if you wish you can stay, as long as you please
Just lend a helping hand up at our cabin by the sea
Where everyday is beautiful, the sun, the sand, the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony

And we'll sing
Just as loud as we please,
And we will be,
Forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees.
Our friends are all around and the storm was a no show,
Said we looked better in the black and white photo.

What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo.

Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand.
We'll fill it up with wood and build a fire with our hands,
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine,
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey and the wine

And we can pass it all around, until it's all gone,
Put a message in the bottle, put the cork back on.
We'll throw it in the sea, the message it will read,
If you find this don't send help, send another bottle please!

And we'll sing but just as loud as we please.
But and we will be, forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.

Said we look better in the black and white photo.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.

What the photograph don't show,
Is where we're headed tomorrow,
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo.
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Say we look better in the black and white photo.

And when the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to sit around.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire, start a fire.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to drink around.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire, start a fire.
When the sun goes down,
We can start a fire to sing around.

Like my momma, my daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Rachelle but I guess I still got the whining Roy
My couzins sweet, momma lay that Jason
Lord I'm praying for swacking my heart is still impatient
Keep 'em off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell bed or what it was
Yeah smoking get a buzz, but God I hear ya calling
And shit wrong wit balling
But my soul is just stelly [steadily] balling
And the sex and the dead, and the other jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell?

Lord they hum Reynold Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something
My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is stelly pumping
My heart is stelly breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man
I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn
Bout yo love, yo will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark
Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more

I'm cruisin, hoes choosin
That's cool 'cause I'm Cadillac pimpin
Spoke spinnin, gold grillin
Liquor spillin, Cadillac pimpin
Keep ridin, car slidin
That's cool 'cause I'm Cadillac pimpin

Now as I grip and dive, I smoke on to keep a high
In the sky, as I emphasize the right to reply
With these words you under heard I swerve through a blur
Dodging these f*ck niggaz who figure we outta splurge
And if happen to have the nerve, see homeboy you made a choice
For the crime you standing on and walking on is getting poise
Plus the Cadillac's we pimpin so slightly you been slippin
On really how it goes when these ties begin to grippin
And shiftin and whole takin to the spot where hoes shakin
I'm quakin, ridin on out - am I gon make it?
And pimp fool like niggaz with gataz without no chaperone
So see, we been doing this from way back long
'92, aqua blue, on them thangs we roll
With a cup full of liquor blowing good on swole
So let's ride til we can't ride no damn more
We Cadillac pimpin hard see my nigga fa sho'

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
Sure be white Cadillac but I called it to go
This your boy Sean Paul, baby tell 'em the truth
So roll Old Fleetwood with the two door coup
All platinum bill with the fifth wheel too
And give truth to these suckas something overdue
Ride a 'Lac like a true playa 'posed to do
Old school, slant back with a jigga too
Tan gold wit some bows like a poster boo
Old school, gold chain, still grippin the grain
Show a crease in my jeans, stay ahead of the game
Got a, piece on my grill, diamonds off in the back
And got so many hoes had to change up my 'Lac
All day I don't know how to act
Got this game down pat, sure be running the track
Get some money from these hoes and see how they react
Show 'em how a real nigga come down like that

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
I got a 'Lac with a rag, Louie Baton top
Diamond cut interior, 15's the knot
I'ma be a last nigga from the ATL
y'all hell, feel eyes and the playa can sell
When you see me in the street, holla at me playa
My bitch got duke, e, rose and wine, boo as fine as hell
Through the strip'll never die, only time'll tell
To be in, it's Cadillac steerin wheel

[J-Bo]
Say what, gather round for this two door show
We let the spillin go, rillin in the Eldorado
We rollin through the spot to see which hoes gon follow
'cause we get cool and down passin rounds of bottle
With a gloss so clean, I put this thing in throttle
For we out and cruise in the wind like roscoe
So you gonna know us when you see us when we ride on by slow
'cause this shit'll never end through the eyes of my foes

We could cruise around
Listen to the sounds till the sun goes down

Starin' at my window at you
Am I the same without you
And I ain't the same without you
Can't even do my thing without

You
So gone to the one that I love
And I remember how it was
I wish I could be back there 'cause
I want to be there where I can

We can hit the shore
We can hit sunset (we can hit the stars)
There's a party goin on in every corner
That's why I gotta be in california

Am I the same without you
But life ain't the same without you
'Cause I know that it'll be too long

Tears for my eyes cry blue
I love it when the breeze comes through

"[Chorus:]
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit

In a showroom frame I attract another hit
If you run to the sun, call Lu, then you trip
I think it's time for you to retire, you skipped
That's what you get when you suck too much less
You get penis end, like the girl in the tight dress
A mess hall, we all in your balling
There's no where to run when the roll is calling
May it be me, cause I flow from within girls
Tell me I'm a hoe, drop the stereo and we can flow
Loop like cause this might be magic
Watch it might engulf you and catch your snatch
There it is, what it is
A house is in the middle of the street
To swallow my gift is a feat
But I hate to see without eyes
When people try to sabotage
But I'm quite successful at espionage
Try harder man, come on harder
Cause if you don't, then come on, why bother
You're in my air evaporate at a rate greater than wait
I'm changing fate
Hey, look
I made ya look
Who's in the kitchen cookin' chicken, mama
Excuse me baby I don't mean to interrupt
But my mind's corrupt now that you got my interest up
You're best I edit the wish bones before I credit
Cause I must show my versatility facility
Peep me like tom
Must you, I bust you
I smash you into dirt and leave your crew laughin' at ya
I'm coolin' like Laverte
You're hurt if I'm leavin' you

[Chorus]

Plot thickens
When reflects is flex like the sex faces
Into private places
It's me baby
(Is it you Lu?  Really really you?)
Touch me and tell me if it's true
Did ya miss?
(Yeah, I miss.  Did you?)
Yeah I miss
Then commence to kiss kiss give me sugar
Cause you be the bona fide baby booger
You know, we go together like a gun and a trigger
(Yeah right, then who's this?  I can't believe this.  
I thought I was the world to you.  Shit, what is this?)
Come on baby, you're trippin' to illusion conclusions
You think I would want that old broken down car
Now who picks me up when I'm down
Come on, who puts a smile on my frown
Come on who makes mmmm
(You crazy)
So then let's blow this joint with God speed
Cause you know, I've got the remedy for what you need
Twelve inches of steel, spinning wheel
Cause you can't fight the feel when I'm in
Better turn the volume up to ten, and dim the lights
Cause tonight, you're takin' flight

Ah, but the next day somethin' went wrong
Huh, she slipped
Found a note, must've fell from her coat
Said I'll meet you at the Eaton Centre at a quarter to eight
And don't be late
Okay, so I thought about the shit that my mind was going through
Took two pills and then called the crew
My crew said ""Chill King, we'll fix it, don't sweat it.""
""Bother you? Don't let it.""
I got it

[Chorus]

But that's what you get
Like a need a mostly dream
Like a dream, you sit inside a pit and you fiend
Now pain, pick ax and shovel, I digged and
I gotta get out, I gotta get out, gotta get out
Of this pit, I'm bigger than her
But my chest is crushed turned to mush
For real
If I ever shot myself it was just to get the feel
So suicide was out of the question
Did I mention
I didn't get a tricycle, thanks to Mr. Trojan
I'd be walking around like these other brothers, trippin'
Aimlessly, like a record skippin'
But once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy and I won't lie
MC's that think I didn't evolve got something comin'
I sleep with words and verbs is my pussy
Fattened like a cat, got your tongue you dirty rat
There's some wisdom in retreat, think of that
Your impact is hollow and you follow and submerge
Now people pull your card, you're livin' on the verge

We understand each other
It's somethin bout the cover
We always usin rubber
She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That's why she so down
Creepin so much
You would think we neighbors
She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'ma give her the go

She won't roll with a player like you
She want to roll with a player like me

Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad 'cause your girl keep callin

I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I'm not the man, we're not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don't understand

Now, in troubled times
I find soul in reaching
What I'm seeking seems so far

That life's mechanical
So tyrannical
It blows my mind
Just what we'll be reaping
And weeping so help us god
Never knew that I
Could be looking why
Are so many
Breaking
Making castles of sand
Every man
Want to be the one
Want to be the one to be
King for a day but its slipping away
And I'm happy
Most melodical things I say
To release the pain
And cease the rain
In my brainstorm
I can't hide
From inside
Escape to, the outside
And I'll be flying away.

For the rest that don't care this a message straight to your heart
Nothing you say now can turn me away
I'm walking the path, never-le me a stray

On the broken glass
On the smoking pass

What can we be?
Can we be free?
Where can we go?

Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit pop ya bottles toast to screen cheers!
Getcha 2-step cuz it's the record of the year
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,
Officially announcing that this is warfare
Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away
But then i sold my first verse that cut the NSX
But i was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,
But now,

My business so clear out the window of the leer
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear,
Listen clearly now,
Hello, can you hear me now?

So can i have it like that?
You got it like that
Can i have it like that?

On and on and this beat is zoning,
I control the mind straight over the phone,
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,
They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,
She knows the time she sees the richard mille,
Flat double skeletal tourbillon
Its just like her body move it turns her on,
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,
I'll get it ok, let it boil away,
But please run along, cuz ladeez is feelin wrong,
And I got some right for 'em right after this song
Cuz my name is Skate-Board-P

And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick,

On and on and the temperatures warming
I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,
Bright as a bitch
So analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at
No skateboy P too grown
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone
It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!)
I don't smoke but i bet the... love it!
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,

You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,
But all these little nigaas got something in reach

Throw a string on the pony so I can tote my son around

Thin as that line down the hundred that you can tell if it's real

Smooth as Sinatra, you can tell by my pops that I'm street
F*ck the forecast, I'll let you know what day'll be heat
See, I recruit smart niggas with heart, no dumb niggas
Who will kill over money, not bitches like some niggas

I think marketable, f*ck y'all niggas who stay bummin'
I'm that nigga sellin' pills at all of Howard homecomings
If you get high, I got weed an' if you get drunk, I got vodka
An' if you want base, I got popcorn like Orville Redenbocker

See, I'm bullseye, I empty my banana in your bandanna
First try, never will my bullets miss a vick
I use one to do a hit on some professional shit

An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Outta three-fourths of them niggas who cross your path
Minus them half ass who talk fast an' finish last
Who gon' get his cash, turn to his man an' give him half
Cock the hammer back, stood by his side an' didn't dash
When the charge is federal an' they fingerprint his ass

Who can he trust to be in front of the judge screamin'
?It's just me?, it must be more than just a nigga love
Make 'em do five joints, no contact without givin' his niggas up
Give his keys to his truck, wish his niggas luck

Call it's best fit, suggested that she let his niggas f*ck
Finger f*ck them figures up, no parole, bigger truck
Kasino is that name big enough, nigga, what?

You wouldn't bust your gat wit me if you never sat wit me
Lit up a sack wit me or hustle some crack wit me
Came through the cipher, bow down an' spat wit me
Hopped up the truck an' gave niggas daps wit me

You never laugh wit me, never went half wit me
Never been through the struggle, never felt the wrath wit me
Never slept on the same floor or hit the same whore
Ran up in the same store or with the same four

Blood thicker than water only in certain cases
You need water to live, you learn that in the basics
Better cherish your aces, bullets in the faces of the jokers
We laugh at fire, nigga, we smokers
Sittin' on the sofa, puffin' the hash, nigga, we focused
Why lie? I die where the coke is

Can I, can I have breakfast in bed?
Can I give you that feeling?
Can we share a sunrise together?

Where are you sleeping, baby
What are you doing, honey
When are you leaving, I gotta know?
Not talking dirty, baby

Can I give you that feeling?
Can I show you the sunrise, can I?

Could be our last chance
And we may not see one another ever again
So I'll sing into your ear mama
While everyone does the cha-cha
Until we're lovers, can we pretend?

"Started off on the island, AKA Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone dialin'
Back in the days of 8 now, making a tape now
Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
Till I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shooting that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend, jetting the Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushing the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up
Better watch your back and duck
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!
F*ck that!

Dedicated to the winners and the losers
Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
Dedicated to the Y's, 850-I's
Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
Dedicated to MPV's: phat!

Kicking the fly cliches
Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall
My first joint, and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure
Settling for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way to

I been waitin' for you I'm glad that you came
Thanks for returnin' my message
How do you like the new place?
You see it's kinda lonely
Can't you tell it's kinda lonely?

Reminds me there’s an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me
I’m skanking all round the party I’m skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right

Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME

And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars

And all the pussy that come with it
So full of focus I'm insistent on keeping it going

Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored
The truths back, locking and closing the door
Brick wall in the road

Show the face of what compares to mine
You want to war?

"There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids about how life is golden
So I will light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, eight by tens
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Collidin' with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See, I almost felt a tear drop

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Cas, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin' on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up; rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry to win the game in the finals, kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first make love

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable; it's the end 'cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer, nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it, a'ight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

With strange haids of braids shade?
Switch place life and life plays with thumb pain?

Three dimension nice, stay on point like Wes Snipe

Let's creep, New York City hold me down wit the heat
Mandatory ease, reppin' from Flushing to 12 Street
Delete, all these knuckleheads lookin' for beef
I'm vexed, half ya niggas don't deserve our respect
We take, regulate, Royal Flush out state
Penetrate, through other areas, hustle and wait
No mistakes, just a large nigga livin' wit fate
Celebrate, and have the whole world buyin' my tape
I'm just a kid on the block, hustlin' till I'm not
Poppin' Crystal in yachts, layin' low on the docks
Wit big Willie niggas, gettin' riches, my life switches

The male genius, hittin' shorties, lookin' European
And overdosin' ghetto potion so the Gods are toastin'

The verbal chosen wisdom, hold me down when I'm frozen
You stay dozin', the best is now rosin', my man
Comprehend a lot, but don't understand
So update ya plans, or be broke just like your mans
Hit like iron hands, the dapper don, computer plans
The Wastlanz, expands, in grands and cross lands
Analyze the scans from Queens, ya niggas only dream, so pathetic
When it comes to guns, ya need to jet, forget it
All ya petty niggas always scared to set it

"So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard
So what do we do girls, shout out loud
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore
But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back

You're just a little boy
Think you so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy

Yo, I'm making short term goals, when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a Big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, coping three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see ya scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning?
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machine-in
My cup runneth, over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin'
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up

To give you a piece of my mind (cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam' roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Till legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

But until the late thang I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you're makin me feel

I'm just tryin to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew, something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Auto off the champagne, Cristal's by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though (who?) Me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas, can a nigga, see me?
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it?  Good, me either
Let's, get together and make this whole world believe us huh?
At my arraignment, screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, f*ck you even!

I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya

To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide

Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely

Bang with us? I don't think so, we platinum plus
With no airplay so ain't shit for us to discuss
But when we hit, you can't understand how we did it
At home praticin tryin to learn how we spit it
Forty-eight hours of old tea like Nick Nolte
Young but O-G's at this rap shit nigga please
One hit for all of us to start eatin 
And wild stack on three weeks on bowell leather beats
Our parents are sharp like cactuses
And you can tell by chips, we sleep on matresses
Dimes flooded out in the hidous
Shit you see in magazines, cut out we freak them hoes
Drop them clothes, double expose you in the lens
Now relax as we videotape you in the bed

(Chorus 2x)

Jay:
If we talk about dollars, only thing I turn down is my collar
Pull out turn them around, if he reach make him holler
Who runnin the town? The Goodfellas
Puff is the godfather, dog, so why bother?
With the third-person, you might catch me surfin
Money I be jerkin, my newborn be burpin
Can't stop, won't stop, I want respect
And I only bum heads with checks
In the suite with this honey from Bangladesh
Pop a snapple, I (?) lay on my chest
All I had to do was get it there, she doin the rest
Take a L to the head, then we listen to flex
Yes, the black hood, and I mack good
With hydro and chocolate mixed in backwood
Ask yourself, do you rap good or act good?
Baby we ain't gon' stop, but you should

(Chorus)","Can't Stop, Won't Stop",Rap
"Open a the herb gate selling pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercover
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not having it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja boom! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit the window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
but I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm falling, hit the ground and start crawling
Soon I'm walking 'round, blending in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell laying on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistling a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom bap against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screaming
Then someone said (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreaming!"")
I said, ""Yo dreaming?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessing, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinking about being tied up
Snap out of it, I'm thinking, ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
and I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny"" (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"")
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear (""Yo, move from the door!"")
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said what up?
They was sticking you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click
I said wait, but it was too late","Can't Stop, Won't Stop",Rap

Roll it up and Diddas, who tipped in for the 10 bag 
Etcetera, I roll my blunts with two textures 
Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras 
It's the truth like funk 180 proof 
Don't drop your drawers I'll f*ck through your daisy dukes, true 
Put your fingers up in the air if your high

I was built like two tits but now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet 
Now who got the funk, we got the funk 
A yo well, I got the weed, we got the blunt 
I never sniff, I used to puff Buddha's in the jail 
Back in 88 when it was 20 cent a gram 
You couldn't read me in braille, hell 
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L 
The fly guy with force like Luke sky 
Down for 8 ball see twa bitch if you fly 
The funkadelic been rockin' mic's since the fourth grade 
I terminate like X and I terminate like Schwarzenegge' 
Dum di dum, rock like Buju Banton

Waste Nigga's like toxic, wet like galoshes 
Can I handle my biz? Yes you can

How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?

There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said ""I take you just the way you are!""
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder

And if you really didn't care, what you callin' me for
It's all about the game that I kick
To get inside her head and make her want to lick on it quick
The silly trick suck it up like a tick
The average playa don't understand what the Pimp be gamin' her with
Don't give a damn who you claimin' you with
Because I know you in love every time I see yo pretty brown eye contacts
I got you grippin' yo seat
Cause I know you plan to sweat girl every time I see ya smile back
I ain't pretty or nothin' 
But still I got enough game to back it all up when I leave
I got another trick up my sleave
I'm killin' 'em softly every time I get 'em down on they knees
I know you want these N-you-T's
Cause I do a lot of shows and you think I got plenty cash
Saw a bunch of girls in the past
So I'm only chillin' with pretty chickens that ? keep a pretty stash
So you know I ain't finna pass
A pretty opportunity to get them girls sprung with the tongue
So tell the freaky trick I'm finna come
So watch me ??

To spit this game and make yo broad want to sleep with me
See I know you want to creep with me
I got a fifth of that Hennessy and some killa that'll weaken yo knees
Dirty skeez won't you freeze at ease
And drop to the beat
Or better yet won't you lay on yo back
But you need to stop teasin' me
By squeezin' me and just let my finger get to workin' with that
You know the game that I'm kickin' is fat
I met you last night and I already got the game in check
When you heard my words
I struck a bloody nerve
I see the way I got you jumpin' when I'm kissin' yo neck
Don't be afraid of them playa effects
Silly whoa don't you know that my game got you goin' for broke
So when you choke off that contact smoke
I got that game to break you down and plus a lil' some for yo throat
And when I'm done I'm ready to go
I'm walkin' out yo do'
I leave ya down butt-naked on the flo'
Understand that you messin' with a pro
When this night is over ain't no need for you to call me no mo'
Cause I'm headed to the next show
To get the next whoa to scheme her outta all her dough

Now look here shawty called me up when he leave

Me creepin' and sneakin' up in yo house when yo man leave home
But this gator head on bone
You makin' it worse because you babblin' about yo thong
Boostin' me up on the phone
To come on in and creep what I can
And then I dash on
I got yo mind - oooh it's so blown
You know that it's gone

Girl I got the keys to yo door
You know you do understand when I lay you down I gotta go
You know what I came here for
So don't be trippin' when I come try to claim you don't know
We finna make a flick trick
So get on yo knees
We gon' call it ""Strip Deep Throat 4""
And to all the whoas that don't know

You need to lick around on the tip

"It's mine, it's all mine you understand?
At least me and my peoples, can you dig that?
21st century thought I'd never see it
Right around the corner, baby ours for the taking

Yo, I've seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin' us
Watching us close, marking our toast [unverified]

Purposely overtaxin' the earnings
Nervous, burning down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Always in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust

Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin' my own, I'm livin' alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl

She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin' and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin' the issue here, so we can cross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin' fired and hired as a pistol-eer

There's no longevity living off negativity
F*ck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin' song
Word is bond, takin' my life you know they lovin' it
God 'F' the government and it's fuckin' capital punishment

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne

We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what it's worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

I've seen it all up close, shit out the movies you'd be buggin'
My cousin JuJe, barely a juve', lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin'
Barin' a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin'

Wearin' the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin' his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, f*ck a snuff, we bust lead off

Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohican's, 'The Last of the Po' Ricans'
We need some unity, f*ck all the jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity

The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess the motto we promise to let you homage in death your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, 'cause Punishment's what I resemble

I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin' in my back, I'm tryin' to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggaz at?

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne

We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

You like that, it's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than gold mines, makin' progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nuttin' y'all can do to behave

We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentality

My strategy's why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
It's no surprise, but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta

While Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm, never shaky, calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day

I got the fireplace, bearskin rug so kick your feet out
Hit me on a hit bay hundred I got the weed out
Hydro keep it on low now bust the weed out
Slide off the DKNY's so I can eat out

Crash, pan the falsetto to smash
The glass, it's a drive-by lullaby
That couldnt get worse, a melody
Abandoned in the key of New York
Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer, hanging
From the rafters, I don't get out
I don't have fun
Livin' like a captive of the sun

Sight-read the chart
Clap the rocks into sand
A twelve-pass van on a pothole bandstand
Got an oil-can hangover by default, and trucks pave
The roads with amphetamine salt
Skull-shakin' cadence of the J train
Rolls the rhythm of defeat, re- peating like a pulse, marching on
And static, lyrics shout a retort
To the melody abandoned in the key
Of New York",Captive of the Sun,Rap
"Fumo, entro, cambio faccia
Come va a finire si sa già
Devo stare attento, mannaggia
Se la metto incinta poi mia madre mi
Perché sono ancora un bambino
Un po' italiano, un po' tunisino
Lei di Portorico, se succede per Trump è un casino

Ma che politica è questa?
Qual è la differenza tra sinistra e destra?
Cambiano i ministri ma non la minestra
Il cesso è qui a sinistra, il bagno è in fondo a destra
Dritto per la mia strada
Meglio di niente, más que nada
Vabbè, tu aspetta sotto casa
Se non piaci a mamma tu non piaci a me
Mi dici ""lo sapevo"" ma io non ci credo
Mica sono scemo
C'è chi ha la mente chiusa ed è rimasto indietro, come al Medioevo
Il giornale ne abusa, parla dello straniero come fosse un alieno
Senza passaporto, in cerca di dinero

Io mi sento fortunato
Alla fine del giorno
Quando sono fortunato
È la fine del mondo
Io sono un pazzo che legge, un pazzo fuorilegge
Fuori dal gregge, che scrive ""scemo chi legge""

Suspense, un attimo prima del sequel
Cachet non comprende monete
Crash Bandicoot raccogli le mele
Nel mio gruppo tutti belli visi
Come un negro bello diretto a Benin City
Non spreco parole, non parlo con Siri
Felice di fare musica per ragazzini
Prima di lasciare un commento, pensa
Prima di pisciare controvento, sterza
Prima di buttare lo stipendio, aspetta
Torno a Baggio, io non me la sento senza
Shakera!
Il tuo telefono forse non prende nell'hinterland
Finiti a fare freestyle su una zattera in Darsena
La mia chat di WhatsApp sembra quella di Instagram
Amore e ambizione già dentro al mio starter pack
Prigionieri di Azkaban fuggiti da Alcatraz
Facevamo i compiti solo per cavarcela

Until your brain can't think for itself, it's just driven by the rage inside
Best not slip like a baby on ice
Some man are sharp to react like Arabian knights
I'm at a stage in my life
Where I don't care for the hype
I just wanna better my career
If you've got a vendetta though, I'm here
We can make arrangements right
No snake, I'm a crane in flight
The dangerous heights
Painting a page like Damien Rice
When it's late and I'm high
Tryna bring the painting to life
Like my boy Rawz Artilla, I can do what I want, I can say what I like
I can make dead ravens fly
In the jaded sky when I spray these rhymes
I got pointed a gun at my lyrics
Clicked on the trigger then I waved goodbye
I'll put the bar in the sky
I ain't alive, and dead men don't die
Tell them all that it's Devlinstein
Infecting minds 'til they're F'd like mine
When I'm in effect I'm electric
I'm like Jay Fox, I'm electrolive
But there ain't no Spiderman
They try to defy the plan, I'm insighting this fiery land there's no hiding here
Come and find me right where I stand
No budging, faking, bluffing, all I can do is play with a hand
I was given in a place called Britain, where the sun don't shine when the rain comes down
I ain't no liar
Doggzy and Siah
All the first man in grime are the fire
That make me feel like taking a wire
I'm wrapping it around your neck when I step
Dev's the messiah
Hybrid fire
Cloning my genes with the genie of hire
Understand I'm gonna wreck this set
I bite, I don't bark, get a tetanus check
Whoever you select or dissect in so many sets when I send these threats
I'll treble any bet that you've set
Wait until my lyrics start taking effect
Breaking the spirit of the jaded
Backslash faded, and new-comers with the rep
'Cause I'm watching, so watch it
I'm clocking every goddamn step
Mic check, if you wanna be in set well stiffen up your Exoskeletons
Insects wanna creep and crawl around me 'cause they heard that I'm Devlin
In jest I should slaughter you all and then bury 'em for acting feminine
Contest, and I'm making you subject one in my strange experiment
Malevolent, pain indefinite
Dark development, Drugnam resident
Periodic when I store every element
You'll never know what's in store for your regiment
J don't give an F to the K
I know you see the inside of the presidents
Brains sprayed by the great
Country that we gave birth to that buried them
I've never been credited fully, I know
That's why I've gotta play this bully-ish role
You don't wanna f*ck with me, I look nice, but I'm not like the Annabelle doll, you know
Devlin is going on cold, you know
This is the OT show, you know
I ain't never sold my soul, you know
Devlin's ruthless, like a house in a hurricane, quick here I come again
Well equipped for this shit when I run away
When my tongue get burnt like a ginger on a sunny day
Don't care what he'd fucking say
Telling me I'm nothing great, you muppet wait, I'm big like Puffy's mate
I'll put your name in a letter and I'll seal your fate
I maintain no pain, no gain
Youngest veteran inside this game
I've earned my stripes, burnt these mics
I inspired these kids when I came
OT to the days of the movement
Major improvement making a change
My name's not a drug, don't use it
It just might ruin your day (Ruin your day, ruin your day)",Castella Freestyle,Rap
"Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see I came and exchanged of a sane man's sanity,
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright
But all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while, I dare you I'll scare you
While it really seem like the kings life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Honestly to me,
I think I'd lose every benefit
Of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me
Than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin' with flip,
Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, aye I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did ya dog
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

For the record aye, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell this
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of god's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty,
I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle for the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls",Castle Walls,Rap

But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
Before you play, take a page of my own advice
It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
And what's the rush man? nowhere else to go tonight
And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
The choice is yours, your down for the cause
Be hated or adored, but never ignored
And whatever card you draw you can't win them all

You haven't got it made, but you got your options
Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
What you tryna live longer? take a bow
What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
So no politics or parties, even if
We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
Now isn't that ironic? no Alanis Morissette
We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle

Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so

"Most people are curious
Some want to get dirt on
The Centaur; I'm famous
I walk around with no shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down
People are afraid of me but act like they love me
Feast your eyes upon my nudity
I am Beauty AND the Beast
I have plenty to say
But nobody listens because my cock is so big
And the end of it glistens; so I'm famous for it
""Freaky"" is what everyone's name is for it
Sure, it's larger than yours
I'm a CENTAUR for Chrissakes!
I like to eat rice cakes and listen to classical music
I'm told passion is my specialty
But really I'm old-fashioned
I'm quite well-built
As fas as physiques go
So people seem to think that I belong in a freak show
They want to have pictures taken
Constantly assumin' that my sex drive 
is three times that of a normal human
Askin' silly questions like I'm their personal mentor
All they care about is my big dick because I'm the centaur
The porno industry
Wants to pay me lots of money to appear in books and movie
'Cause they think I look funny
But I'm lookin' for true love
Not groupies and freaks
More than a huge cock - I have a complicated mind
I'm not the favorite kind of companion
For the average person
Sometimes things start well
But eventually worsen when sex becomes a problem
Or else they're unimpressed with the attention that you get
Bein' a centaur's love interest
You don't care about my next life
Just my ex-wife and the intimate details of our sex life
Most people are curious
Some want to get dirt on
The Centaur; I'm famous
I walk around with no shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down",Centaur,Rap

Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic and you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up like a mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton but I don't wear sheer

Yo, money, don't chump yourself

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide 'cause you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-why-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light?  It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

Holiday en Chaco con tu cosita 

Todo se remite a ver lo que es 
Parado frente a mi no lo podrás ver 
Húndete en el Chaco y comienza a rezar 
Que del impenetrable no podrás zafar 

Selva de mis venas, tierra de jaguar 
Árbol sangre verde que tu quieres podar 
Dame bendiciones, hay que despertar 
Chaco piel de indio, nunca morirás en el 

Chaco estoy bailando en chaco 
A mi me gusta el Chaco 

Holiday en Chaco con tu mamita 
Holiday en Chaco con tu cosita 
Contigo desnudita 

Mis piernas son hierbas que sirven de enlace 
Pretendo atraparte y reírme en tu viaje 
Noche chaqueña luna plateada 
Lo nuestro se encuentra en una llamarada 

No fue tan cruel la mujer del guailo 
Cruzando el viento, quemo el horario 
Pidió perdón a los allí presentes 
Y dio su vida para que lo pienses 

Porque los guailos no entran al Chaco 
Porque tu guailo no entras al Chaco 

Holiday en Chaco con tu mamita 
Holiday en Chaco con tu cosita 
Contigo desnudita 

Ceferino te adoro, nunca usaste trajes de oro 
Los niños comieron gracias a tu tesoro 
Propongo mi paladar para dar verdad 
La venda de tus ojos cayo y no volverá 
Hombre al presente planeas indignarlo 
Usando nuestras tierras tu basura iras creando 
Pero no te das cuenta que la tierra es Chaco 
El viento tomara tu frágil alma en un charco

El agua que tomas, el agua te toma

I dig that ditch I chop that corn I curse the day that I was born 
I believe it's better for a man to hang than to work like a dog on a chain gang 

The guard stands there with a great big gun I bet he'd love to see me run 
And I guess I probably will some day I'd rather be dead than to live this way 
He's well fed and he's six foot tall and he's a meanest of them all 
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane the sun must've touched his brain

We hit like mack trucks what the f*ck was you thinkin'

Cause I know the spotlight invites greedy and grimey individuals in my

Stop it's Down Lows turn to rock 
Give me the mic plus gas to lock shows in blocks

And if I ever fall from the top I'm a splatter
Then heat my way back to hot
It's a natural fact when it's wack I conteract

And take 'em back you motherfuckin' right it's like that
I'm strapped with double edge swords and a mac
For ya area bitches got me runnin' from the cat

"Why..
Why..

I'm a junkie, lookin through my book
I can't be cured, I know I'm hooked
I gotta get out the house, I'm so hard
Chasin that cat all over the yard
But why, do I chase the cat?
Been at it so long since way back
Why would I want to be a player for life?
Spittin this game every day and night
I'm talkin, body language, facial expressions
F*ck a flight attendant on a layover session
She's servin my dick
Fallin in love, but she ain't my bitch
Why do I need to be in between her
Since the first time I seen her?
Hit it from behind, now she want to be mine
I'm all up in her feline

[Chorus]
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money
Why must I, chase the cat?
You see ain't nothin changed, but the game, pimpin ain't easy

Uh, bein settled down, just ain't for me
Hold hands, walkin down the aisle, bout to get married
I thought that once, will never think it again
Cause I'm a player in the game and I'm playin to win
It's too many fine hoes to be stuck with one
Too many wet pussies just to be fuckin one, shit
It's like a disease, like JT in ""Five Heartbeats""
It's impossible for me to be with one freak
You can't live with me, you can't live without 'em
I never would trust a bitch and I don't doubt 'em
Cause I'm a dog that love to chase the cat
If you a fine bitch, I might put my face in that
If you do me first, then I'll do you
And the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Hoes nowadays be as bad as us
They love to suck f*ck and bust fat ass nuts

[Chorus]

Ever since I was a youngster, new to the game
I was goin to the mall, baby what's your name
And your number - I never been under
Always been a outright player no wonder
I been through so many hoes in the last 20 years
Bitch gettin fucked, bring her ass up in here
I keep two or three hoes on deck
Too $hort baby don't take no shit
I'm a pussy junkie, and bitches always want me
But my first love is money
And I'll forever be faithful to her
I won't give her to a bitch just to do her
And play with her kitty
Got some nigga's name tattooed on her titty
I see a gat and jump the fence
My name is $hort Dog and I'm a pimp, bitch

[Chorus]
Why must I, chase the cat?
Cause you know.. she's a ho..
Why must I, chase the cat?
Whaddya know.. she gives me dough..
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money",Chase the Cat,Rap

You could do your dance
Take a chance with your lover like this began!
Sing

I want somebody who can take it apart
Stitch me back together make me into who I wanna be
But all you ever do is sit in the dark
Dealing with the Devil, you ain’t never ever gonna be mine

'Cause I’m born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I don’t wanna be around anymore
I’m through giving, I’ve got to go

Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time? (time)
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)

Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

Damn, nigga, damn
Took a chance on you, double and dipped again
And, scram, nigga, scram
Hit your mans up and tell ‘em to get the van
And reminiscing can't
Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan
But man, this the plan
Say goodbye to your lover cause this the end

I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow

Yo, get lost hit the highway, freeway
We've been off-course like the wrong-way relay
Need me a boss, you’re a constant delay
These the kinda thoughts I've been having for three days
Feel like you’re more of a homie
Please, you don’t even know me
You think I’m starting new relations
I’m just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience
And you’re like, “Girl, how you do that?""
My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that
And since we can’t get along
I think we should both move on

'Cause I’m born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I don’t wanna be around anymore

It's E-Dub on the microphone
My style be Elektra, I'm the male Syl Rhome
Homes, walk around with forty-four chrome
On safety, spike the mic in the endzone
This here ain't the average shit, you used to
Front, and automatic rounds, will shoot you
So knock it off, like Biggie Smalls said Duke you soft
Why you want to f*ck with the boss?

[Parrish Smith]
Where should I start? Breakin MC's or shattering charts?
It's Diablo, PMD Mic Doc with the purple heart
The go-getter, getter, get wit 'er, hit 'er-split 'er
Front and back, and if she wit it, straight in the shitter
So Heidi Heidi Heidi hydro, pack gats and ammo
Funky Piano, van like the fucking ?tano?
With more cheese than Lambeau, more heat than Rambo
Break down dismantle when I scramble

Don't get too close because you might get shot

[Erick Sermon]
Uhh, yo, and yo
EPMD, fucking with us is bad news
Me and you got different views
What you might say is dope, I say's not
What I might call wack, you'll call hot
The best thing for you, is to think and hope
Or get choked, and hung with The Velvet Rope
Cause you too theatrical, mess around
And end up smacking you, jacking you, attacking you

[Parrish Smith]
That's why it's crucial, so stay neutral to collect the cash
Double beaucoup, just ripping up mics, is what my crew do
Whatever suits you, pull out the burner, f*ck the shoot through
Roadblocks and smear campaigns, with the two-two
Or tech nine, that'll chew, through your waistline
I'm accurate, don't waste mine, spit on baseline
Run with the unseen potential to be on Dateline
I don't fake mine, you blaze crazy, while I pace mine

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, now why y'all want to mess with the vets?
We've been doing this shit, since Dear Yvette, check
I make shit that make you want to smack your producer
And ice grill him, and make you want to kill him dead
And walk around leaking, in the bed for the weekend
For playing with the last Mahican
Madi gon, that's f*ck you in Puerto Rican
Keep quiet when you hear grown men speaking

[Parrish Smith]
Or get smacked, this ain't no game, the shit is serious
Delirious, that's how we leave cats and niggaz curious
The true legend, got caught shit you better call Kevin
Big like Dog 40 and the Dutch from the 7-11
I'm danger like Norris the Texas Ranger
The mic strangler, PMD, the fucking Head Banger

Pump a nine on the reg behind penitentiary steel

"Yo I refuse to lose even though I'm battered and bruised
They tried to black my third eye but I still come through
Crushin' the lactose rapper, shoot with accuracy 
Conscious cat that's dapper, yo it has to be me
But enough about myself 'cause situations are real
Too many young cats be doing raw deals, you feel?
Getting caught with the tools of the trade
The plan is laid plus the trap 
Been set, we ain't figured this yet
Still paper chasing ignoring the fight that we facing
No love for the ignorant, it's called playahating
Playas stay hated when they oughta be educated
Ego deflated, leave them lies unstated yo
We descendants of kings and queens
Instead of fodder for the cop scenes, know what I mean?
Can't form teams if we ain't thinkin alike
That's why you can feel my thoughts when I'm gripping this mic
Born to get right, born to be a part of the fight
Crushing negative auras with my positive light
Standing strong like David with his sling and his stone
It's official, the Prodigal Son has come home

Ayo I claim throne like Persian kings
My urban theme is to keep my culture pure 
And untampered like virgin queens
Never splurging cream
When I stack I'm merging dreams
Into one plan, rappers getting this green's an urgent thing
Number one on the list, no need to front on this shit
It's a blessing I don't have to vic with the gun on the hip
Got enough ice in the freezer, don't need none on the wrist
Just trees and more Henny, that's how I come in this bitch
Just like y'all man, I just wanted to flip
And hear myself on the air gettin spun in the mix
See you runnin the risk 
Tryin to challenge J-S-A, N-D-S
Yo Grap, these nigga envious?
I'm like the friendliest
Love and peace to any with
The same back to me, that beef shit is wack to me
Because actually I find out the facts to be
That if you have beef, it's to the death naturally
And don't nobody wanna die over dumb shit
So don't front on me because of who I run with
We gotta teach these kids to say no to beef to live
Not by words, but by actions we can repeat the shit
Our brothas killing brothas
Because it only leads to one dead, one in jail
And another story to tell

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

It goes hip hop, shoo bop doo wop
Put a hook on your mind and check the clock
And just do it, and just do it
And you know you got to just do it

Free your mind and define what is true to you
Hold your plan tight, something like paper to glue
I keep it fool proof, set up a base for my youth
When it's all done, she's flying helly's off of roof
Big plans now, working my product against demand now
Takin breath before I take my steps
Now that I'm ready, I execute with great precision
On mission with Sands makin proper decisions

That are critical, Razor Sharp like Bobby Digital
Political, in all angles we stay pivotal
Original, MC smooth individual
I'm down for Rawls, never wanna see my nigga pitiful
Ridicule, I do not, that's just my physical
The one who stared and played the judge and life is the fool
The plan is lyrical, we all just need to get along
And that's the formula of the song
Grap L-U-V in, Sands I'm MCing
While J. Rawls got the funky drums beating, check it out

I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter

Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like mister clean?

Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen

Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that body in El Segundo then push it along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no I'm chaining cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

With speed I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum

Park my Benz or cold jet it on my scooter
Bail to tha coast, take a head of this Skunk
Twist up a big bomb of this serious dope

I was savin' it for later, When I get with my spouse
Cause when we're together, blazin' tha cheeba
She does things to me that you wouldn't believe
I'm not talkin' freaky or nothin' obscene
But it's not far off if you know what I mean
She'll take me upstairs, lay me down on tha bed
Pull off tha Fila shorts n start givin' me hizead (head)
If I was boo I'd do tha same
She must love it, She ain't never complained
They'll be moanin', kickin' a lot of screamin'
I work it so hard she starts steamin'

He could bearly hold them up, They where heavy as lead
An hour went by, He said Loc I'm kinda hungry
I said oh shit! This brothers got tha munchies
Got off my couch, put my Gucci's on my feet
Went to tha Seven Eleven at tha top of tha street
I ordered everythin' edible off tha shelf
He thought it was sad, I ate it all myself
When we got back to tha car, Headed north then south
I needed a drink I had a cotton mouth
We had so much food didn't know where to start
At tha Hagan Daas or Kelloggs Pop Tarts
Big bags of chips, gallons of dips
It took me weeks to get tha taste of my lips
I ate so much miserable is how I felt
Almost busted out my pants had to loosen my belt
Kickin at the tube, wathin' none better than

De toutes les douleurs du monde elle peut témoigner
De la mer elle connaît les secrets
Engloutis sous les vagues et les rochers
Le marchand de rêves lui a cédé
La clé des châteaux d'Espagne et ses contrés
De toutes les fois elle s'est réclamée
Portée par la grâce de Dieu et ses versets

"Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she

Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?

Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see

Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, ayo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine

Ça s'passe, ça s'passe comme ça chez le mac, chez le mac
Ça s'passe, ça s'passe comme ça chez le mac, chez le mac
Ça s'passe, ça s'passe comme ça chez le mac, chez le mac

Les rues sales du centre ville de Mars, c'est mon turf
Mac aussi puissant que ce putain d'argent sur le surf
J'ai tout pris en main et les condés se tâtent
Pas de racket, je suis libre des vapeurs d'eau écarlate
Et des tubes de colle, à coups de latte
Les consonnes, les voyelles, sont toutes à quatre pattes
Proxénète linguistique, pur style manteau en fourrure
Et ma vie, a pris une autre tournure
Je ne sais pas où cela me mène
Mais même ceux qui m'aiment me décrivent comme étant un schizophrène
J'ai mis les mots au tapin pour la sensation
Au trottoir les syllabes, prostitué la diction
Les lettres travaillent pour moi
Le dico est mon territoire, un pays dont je veux être le roi
J'ai traité des phrases comme de vraies dames
Tiré les plus belles pour les mettre en vitrine comme à Amsterdam
Si tu veux la qualité normal, tu payes et cash
Ça arrache, à consommer avec un tchoc de hasch
J'ai des potes dans la profession, c'est pas la mode
Mais pourquoi crois-tu que DRS s'appelle Mr Claude?
Petit parade avec tes illusions de Benz
T'es une merde sur le marché parce que tes phrases sont renze
C'est dommage, t'es guetté par le chômage
Mon organisation est trop en place et bien trop sauvage
Ma famille vient de ce quartier, qui faisait peur à Hitler
Où la French est née pour niquer la terre entière
Je m'en souviens encore mais pourtant je devais être petit
Scarface n'est pas un rêve, il a existé ici
L'Italiano prend la relève vingt ans après
C'est tout un autre monde, c'est tout un autre marché
Je suis discret, distant, dispo, prêt à disparaître
Mon discours éternel, seul un rêve peut renaître
Un jour, sous une forme nouvelle
D'un novice, vingt-six lettres, cent mille mots à son service
N'est pas mac qui veut mais je croise des concurrents sérieux
Alors je redouble de travail et serre le jeu
Si tu veux la bombe, tu raques Ronald
Ça s'passe comme ça chez le mac

Le petit noir à tête rasée réapparaît
Moi non plus j'ai pas changé, toujours prêt à dégainer
Mon micro branché sur une table envoie le morceau
Vérifie la console qu'elle fasse bien son boulot
Ouais, c'est comme ça avec le mic et les samplers
Au doigt et à l’œil, alors qui c'est l'empereur?
La MPC travaille pour moi très dur
Et au moindre bug, je la colle au mur, c'est sûr
La dernière mélodie que j'ai recrutée
S'est prise deux gifles quand elle a refusé de se faire truncater
En fait je suis le seul boss du matos
Tous les câbles qui font les macs tombent vite sur un os
Tout le monde y a droit qu'est-ce que tu crois?
Les lettres, elles aussi, taffent pour moi
Vingt-six lettres chacun sa chacune
Deux claques sur les fesses et vite par ici la thune
C'est comme ça que dans mon job que ça se passe
J'ai beaucoup d'employés et je ne paie rien à l'URSSAF
Et je n'ai pas eu depuis longtemps à sévir
Elles ont réalisé que leur plaisir est de me servir
Si elles le font bien, je les place dans des phrases
Promotion sociale pour elles, pour moi, ha! Plus de liasses
Mais le fin du fin, c'est le couplet quand elles y sont arrivées
C'est qu'elles sont classées top dans mon carnet
Celles qui attendent de moi un geste en retour
Ont beaucoup d'espoir, d'ailleurs elles courent toujours
Je table sur la qualité, pas la quantité
D'un service organisé, créé pour vous faire planer
On y trouve des plates, des croisées, des embrassées
Choisissez, chacune d'elles a sa spécialité
J'ai dû transpirer dur pour y arriver
Mais ça sert d'avoir de la famille bien placée dans le métier
Le prox de l'apostrophe, le Jules de la Virgule
J'aurais dû faire du foot, j'ai toujours eu le sens des putes

One licks a lollipop
Manolo Blancs, it's hot
Her seven spit like heaven

A chic like you
Can move and shake it fast
Boys wait for her to pass
Because that girl is bad

Chic like you
She soaks in green tea lotion
Her legs are so outspoken
You'll think this girl is naked

Chic like you
The girl is always sexy
She loves backseats in taxis
And talking good and trashy

I mean the chic like you like just won't stop
Unbutton the top and later hear that k-k-knee drop
I could take you to the Opera and back to the block
Manolos and Gucci Lyn this chic is hot

For real and I mean sizzling hips get the twistness
Switchin' she keep all the playas whistling
She do the foo in bikinis and heels
The way she lick the bits and suck the ice and give a grown man chill

Oh girl when the attendant flip her own whips
Flew a playa the Vegas's for their own chips
Life of the party, the two step queen
She rapped when she seen me with them painted on jeans

You know I don't hit no better than her
Feel like I'm drunk when I see her and I slur my words
She's sexy and classy and she's my type
We can make it last forever just one night what they do, why, why

Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing
Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing

I need a chic like you
That don't know when to quit
Likes me to jump on it
And I just met her girlfriends

Chic like you
One with an open mind
Lets me eat cherry pie
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Will always keep me guessing
What's under that long jacket
I got this real bad habit

Now if this sounds like you
Girl, let me come inside

You might be my type, my type, my type, my type, my type, my type

"Sie is' immer da wo was los is'
Immer mitten in der Stadt
Dort wo die kleine Welt ganz groß is'
Sieht sie sich an den Lichtern satt

Sie erzählt dann und wann von dem und denn
Und sie hat jeden schon gehabt
Auch wenn sie sich selbst nicht ganz so pflegt
Pflegt sie zu mindestens den Kontakt

Und sie träumt von Chicago
Von Chicago
Irgendwo wo sie keiner kennt
Und sie träumt von Chicago
Von Chicago
Dort wo niemand, niemand ihren Namen nennt

Mit ihrem sonnigen Traum vor Augen
Läuft sie durch den Regen
Und jeden den sie auf der Straße trifft
Erzählt sie, sie wäre da gewesen

Beschreibt in welcher Ecke sie schon war
Denn sie kennt immerhin dies und das
Und wenn du 'nen bisschen was dabei hast
Nimmt sie dich mit für eine Nacht

Sie nimmt dich mit
Nach Chicago
Nach Chicago
Irgendwohin wo dich keiner kennt

Sie nimmt dich mit
Nach Chicago
Nach Chicago
Dort wo niemand, niemand deinen Namen nennt

Doch wenn man ihr erzählt,
Welchen Traum sie lebt
Dann spielt sie gleich verrückt
Denn auch wenn sie kurz schläft
Sobald das Licht angeht
Dann muss sie schnell zurück

Manchmal trifft sie sich mit ein paar Leuten
An einem unbestimmten Platz
Und wenn dort frischen Zeug durch die Adern fließt
Gibt man den Löffel an die Kumpels ab

Und diesmal ist sie nicht gekommen
Vielleicht hat sie's nicht gepackt
Nur eine kleine Nachricht ist alles was sie hinterlassen hat

Ich komm nie mehr! Ich bin in Chicago
In Chicago
Irgendwo wo mich keiner kennt, oh oh
Ich komm nie mehr! Ich bin in Chicago
In Chicago
Dort wo niemand, niemand meinen Namen nennt! Oh oh
In Chicago

Wo mich keiner kennt
Ich komm nie mehr

Or the chopped chicken on rye?

Cut his fucking eyes out and feed em to his Aunt Milly

Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog will eat em up fast

And there you go, slippin
You promised her another ass whippin
And you slap, slap, slap, now you feelin kinda macho
I Got Game and I took your Benzo
What you gonna do with a cake boy's nightmare
Bought you a nine but you still looked scared
AK-47? Nope
I run a HK-91 with the Leopold scope
So eat that 308, fool
Actin like a joke but Big Mack's rule
You had to inject but boy I shot ya
Meet your new enemy the chief boot knocker

Here's my tomahawk
Here's my tomahawk
Here's my tomahawk
Here's my tomahawk
Here's my tomahawk

I meet a girl named Gail at a soul food restaurant
Big fat rocks on her hand tryin flaunt
Tried to step to her in the hall
She said her ex-boyfriend plays pro football
But I hate quarterbacks, but I like throwback
on a young, fine brown skin snackpack
She got a black SL, it was sittin on 19's lookin all swell
I really don't care about your boyfriend sweetness
Jealousy is every man's weakness
But I ain't no salt slinger, just a gang slinger
And oh yes it's the bird banger
I followed Gail to the crib
Walked in straight trippin off a how the girl lives
Your man is a trick and his game is whipped
I can pull you in a Benzo and a broke down jeep
Take notes off the shit I just wrote
Trick daddies get left in smoke
A lot of copycat niggaz might jack ya
But the game came way with the chief boot knocker

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin the scripture the picture they painted for me
Rippin it runnin and gunnin and aimin for me
Yo.. (yeah, uhh, yeah)

I guess you niggaz told me right and exact
Shak, shak, right in his back
I might just crack while I'm writin this rap
From even, a tire that snap, I'm light in the sack
I tell you how I feel and that's part of the deal
I'm like, Seagal with the steel but ""Harder to Kill""
It's real, big Beans up for lettin me know
Fifteen bet and you blow, better get dough
Won't be a second we won't; they lettin me go
Since pays wisen your ways, allow me to grow
Aiyyo (yo) swing yeah back to the scene
Seven-four-eight-oh, can't recall in between
Whole state pulsate, we can wrinkle the town
Park jams dark shams niggaz breakin it down
Niggaz rock the heaters, my clique rocked Adidas
Didn't know the blocks were where the spots would lead us
But hey..

Livin the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't the game or the greed
Rippin it runnin and gunnin and aimin for me

Scene of that rhyme and you can think what you want
And if you.. and if you tell me you can get it from here
Got boom got boom, put shit in the air (yeah yeah yeah)
Get us some gear to get us in here
Waited years to get a premier and did it from here
Harlem - citizen where the kid is in gear, guard him
Niggaz in here, who get it in here, we are them
Take you back to the 80's around
Polo Grounds, Uptown, eight-eighty a pound
Niggaz hit the rooftop, y'all was roofin the rocks
Other niggaz shoe tops, only youth on the block
You dig me - movin in tops and movin these rocks
You get it - we movin them blocks to move in them drops
Skiddin - I guess the niggaz told me right and exact
When they said stop fightin and stack it - get the money nigga

Eighty-one I had fun, eight-two I was new
Eight-three I did me, eight-four I had grew
Eighty-five it got live, eight-six in the mix
Eighty-seven in the kicks, eighty-eight in the whips
Eighty-nine I had the grind, now I know it was flow
Ninety-one we got guns, ninety-two it was dough
Nine-three was the key, nine-four was sure
Nine-five took a dive, nine-six I was poor
Nine-seven did eleven now I'm made out the gate
Nine-nine spit rhymes two-thousand and straight..

"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.

We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

Lay down your head
You're not alone
Anywhere you go, I follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

Bitch I'm a moon walker like Michael, sky walk all over my rivals
Both hands on that Bible, bitch I'm next in line for that title
When they got had nothing to do, what was I do, who was in the studio with Taio
We climbing high, we on the Kilimanjaro, and they're panicking
They don't really know what's happening
Never gotten clothes off a mannequin, we don't want no comparison
I overdose on extravagance, we went for gold and got platinum
I told my bro' to get an ambulance 'cause I caught a cold and went spazz on them
How can home be where the heart is,
When your shadow even fucking leaves you when you are in darkness
Still get stopped by Sergeant Pepper, looking for that ziggy stardust
After a lifetime of regret, I'm just looking for some answers

Lay down your head
You're not alone

That's all you need to know

Lay down your head

Anywhere you go, I follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

I had opportunity in my window, wise words in my kindle
Disturbing London, we here to ball, your team stuck in limbo
Like Freddie, Bruno and Ringo, I saw the signs and symbols
With that top down on my yellow ride, let bitches hate on my bimbo
I'm yards away from that milestone, international dial tone
Put me through amaro when you Instagram with your iPhone
From yellow bricks to them brown stones, I ring bells, I'm household
Look at all the rappers we outsold so keep your mouth closed, yeah
How did I become so jaded, maybe all these insecurities are making me feel naked
Feel like Harry did in Vegas, had my privacy invaded
That's a liberty a pity, the epitome of what fame is
Priest up in my parish, keep on putting me in their prayers
Swear I'd never sell my soul, my pride and dignity is too major, yeah
We rarely ever get those second chances, after a lifetime of regret
I'm just looking for some answers, yeah

Anywhere you go, I follow

Looking for a light that can outshine the sun
I know one day our time will come
Bought a camera to capture these cinematic nights
Still don't satisfy my appetite for this lavish life
Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?
Like Michael said, it doesn't matter if you're black or white
We got the colors of the sun to descend above us
All we have is each other in case you happen to wonder, let's go

Lay down your head
You're not alone
Anywhere you go, I follow

"Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore Adidas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people was behaving like hip-hop was good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said
""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash
Jacking old beats and making the dash""
They jacked the beats, money came with ease
But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder
Set some R&B over the track for ""Deep Cover"" (187!)
The kid got wild, started acting erratic
He said ""Yo, that presidential I got to have it""
With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track
But little did he know that his joints was wack
The shiny A&R said ""Great new hit, G!""
""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me""
The kid got amped and he starts to figure
""I'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!""
So, he's in the studio working round the clock
For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock'
Was out in the street when he met this sister
Who couldn't sing for shh but the mix would assist her
Hooked up the track and in excitation
He decided he'd head for the radio station
But (What?) he was running and he made a left
Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def
I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money
Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?""
He ran upstairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?)
Jane the chickenhead radio host
Who be yapping 'bout beef between east and west coast
He said ""This one's a bullet, you got to give it run!""
The chicken said ""Thanks"" and spanked it #1
He went outside, was getting props all over
Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover
Raced up the block doing 83
Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D
He winked his eye like his star status mattered
They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
""You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static
And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic""
His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said
They told the kid ""Back down, that player shit is dead""
Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone
But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on
With shades on founded had him astounded and
Before long the young man got surrounded
Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was out chasing cream and the American dream
Trying to pretend the ends justify the means
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
Life is more than what your hands can grasp

Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour

And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it ,different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss

Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah)
Million voices in my head, but still get a little bit of thrill
And some real enjoyment
Off what? Off the feel of going in
Like? Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a M.I.L.F. when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into, rippin' the condom in two, woo!
Dick is a bargain or two, now I'm gettin' blue like Kolonopins
Rude Jude I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views, and comment or two
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan, yeah!
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex
I clock rejects into the next life
Talkin' reckless, that is just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my
Columbian neck tie
Prostitute just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life (sex crime)
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe
Ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kinda nut drives a Budweiser truck, finds a slut
Tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up, binds up
Cuts slices her twice but the muff diver must just like it rough 
F*ck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up, under thighs, uh, like a geyser, uh (music please)
Enthusiast of the roofie, goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi
And have a loosey goosey, it's cool see it's with an Uzi
But I am direct, what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued me be, I'm Tru TV, you're too PG, I'm Schooly D, you're Spoonie Gee
No diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up now I'm back to ratchet up
My attack and I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew",Chloraseptic,Rap
"[Mister Cee:]
I be the cruddy one that they call the DJ Mister Cee, 
With the whole Wolf Pack in the place to be. 
Better known as the Chocolate City. 
So Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me...? 

[Scoob Lover:]
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill, 
My nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville. 
The world's greatest lover, the chocolate brother...

Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)

Scrap Lover are ya with me? 

[Scrap Lover:]
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated. 
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail, 
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today. 

[Chorus x3] 

Big Daddy are ya with me? 

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize. 
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa, 
But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba. 

[Chorus x3] 

Now you know you'd too like to be with it... 

[Li'l Daddy Shane:]
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain. 
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain. 
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice... 

[Laree Williams:]
Ooohhh! Chocolate City are ya with me?!

every time we throw down and every time we puff La
Haaaaa!!! well you can roll my way
on the chocolate supa highway!!!

Late last year
some of ya mighta had fear, that the Spearhead crew
would never be back through your way, no way
we naw go out like that, becaouse we livin' for the riddim
and the funk is always fat so
we bring fat beats like a gift for Xmas
I'll make you testify just like an O.J Simpson witness
our sound is so alarming like killer bees people all be swarming
so like the price is right come on down, make a little wish
but excuse me while I light my spliff and make some noise
if you think the herbs a gift. Hoooo!!

(Chorus)

Check it I'm descending back into this record
the heavy breathing funky rhyme paramedic
shootin' funky venom from my sharp teeth injectors
not vex ya but yes to resurrect ya
'cause I can't stand the pain outside my window
why ya think so many smokin' indo blunts
sippin' gin and juice for confidence
blowin' more la than Jackie Chan be doin' stunts
the Buddah elevates the stress off the chest
but could never elevate boot off the ghetto necks
flex like flash when they try to pull me under
but like the lightnin' I'll be there before the thunder

(Chorus)

Yes I remember the time in Oklahoma
you tried to blame an Arab
but the whitey was the bomber
you be jumpin' to conclusions
I think you spent your whole life
watchin' cable in seclusion
illusions 'bout what's outside your door
one nigga two nigga three nigga four
robbing every house and every liquor store
run for your life we marchin' one million more
Plowing the fields like some natty dread farmers
you can roll your own in September from our harvest
big up yourself... when life comes gets the hardest
Spearheads comin' straight from the cartridge

When she walks in the room I can't help actin' a fool
I know what she like, she act right
She act like she ain't gon' survive the night
Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the f*ck taught ya how to move that fast
It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin'
Bang on your G-spot 'til your (voice is missin')

You should bring your friends though
I'll f*ck you and them too

Suck it, swallow it, down the hatch
It ain't a game when she givin' me brain

I don't waste no time with make-up lines
I just look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
Cause her ass and titties light up the room 
Like a major city
Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin' and I don't care
She come through with a couple of friends
A couple bottles of gin
And then that's where the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks
Baby, get on top and don't you stop

I know you love the way I'm diggin' it out
I know it's hard to talk 
With all this dick in your mouth

I drink your Hennesey fifth, let's work the shit out
She don't gotta cheat 'cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees, side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin' a f*ck, we f*ck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit
And blow your mind
Get in line bitches, stay on the grind
Cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised you can be so pretty
And be so nasty

But I've got to tell you how I feel
Open your eyes, don't try to hide my love
So hard to say but I think it's best
Gotta give your heart its time to heal

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

I'm serious when I tell you, Love
That little heartbreak
Is ten to a dime
Don't be afraid
Just turn the page my love
I'm curious when the day will come
I see my reflection in your eyes
Take your time and I'll be there

Only love, only love
Only love, only love

Looking through my eyes at the world
can't you see
Every time i see your face
There's a choice to be made

Walking hand in hand
Through the sands of time
As I peer into the past
Foreign steps are terrorizing

Watching what is now
There's a fork in the path
Of the future of your life
Which road shall you choose

Choices to be made
Past and present
It's not easy
But my love will let me die
Until your heart resurrects me

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die--you choose

Sometimes I try and
Sometimes I cry
Only love will make me do what I don't wanna do

Resemble monkey wrench though
I don't need your credentials
We men though
Leave you in light and leave you in limbo

She wanna really welcome me to the freak show

If I could give any gift I wanted
A present to every boy and girl
I'd make it a miracle that came from God above
A picture of peace under
Where each person is touched by the power of love

And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it

Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement

"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, ""Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits""
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't"" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, ""They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish""
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

[Chorus]

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""

[Chorus]

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' ""Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess"", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, ""I've got to go""
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry

[Chorus]

Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

"Yeah
You know what's funny?
Seems every time I try to forget about you
My feelings pull you back in
You know, 'cause I got somebody else
And you got somebody else
But you and I both know
What it really is
But still
You know what I'm saying, B?

Ran across a picture you took of me
And you crossed my mind
And it got me thinkin'
'Bout how it used to be
It was just you and me
I still hear you saying you love me
When I close my eyes
Put no one else above me
But that was back then; now you're just a memory
If I didn't go away to school
Then where would we be?
Probably still together and somewhere happy
If I'm supposed to be moved on in a new relationship strong
Then why are you still haunting me?

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
The further I go, the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on

Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle (out of this circle)

I drove past your house the other day
I didn't even mean to
I went the wrong way
I ain't seen your mama in a while
When she looked at me she smiled
And asked me if I'm doing okay
Took everything I had
Not to bring up your name
And wonder if you came home for the holidays, yeah
She asked if I could stay awhile
'Cause you had come in town
And you were just five minutes away

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
The further I go, the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on
Till I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle (out of this circle)

Anybody who's listening to this
If you got that person that makes you wonder what if
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
If you understand how I feel
Then grab that person now and let 'em know what's real
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah, hey

If you love something, let it go
And if it comes back, then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights

Dodgin' the law, dodgin' it sublime
And if you feel me, I'm a keep it real for this episode

What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Like a fucker, who unclockin' the chamber
'Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an OG like my daddy and my grand peppy

Don't ever touch mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better get out to protect in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, no dumb birdy
As I handle my business and as I take you on the journey

It ain't no City of the Angels, brother Mack
It's just people playin' get back and more get back
Yo, a lotta drama on my block, but I never stress
Because I'm build like a Presidential Rolex

A lotta people hustle 'cause they got to

I'm gonna revenge myself like The Crow

I'm movin' fast with a blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream I'd seen a black crow

The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Violence is brought forth too many years
Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

"Gather 'round, gather 'round, hurry
Uh, welcome! uh, little boys and girls
Listen, I'm bout to lace y'all motherfuckers
about Oakland, the City of Dope
The first place in the world to ever sell base rock
nigga, crack rock, they put it there to get rid
of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin
what, what, nigga

Verse 1:

Me and my niggas trying to ride drop
buy rocks then we buy blocks 
from the same dope fiends on my block who buy rocks 
want supply hot
weight servin cakes like IHOP
ever since them last motherfuckers got shot
police been hot on my spot
spot cops FBI watch
got fiber-optic shit up in the pole
showing my whole clique on crime watch
we let non-stop and show our faces
so what the case is
we wide on TV but still the grind don't stop
nigga this Oakland, the city of dope
You know where that crack shit was invented
and smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago
on Plymouth street we call the block
Plymouth Rock 
the first place like the world to ever sell base rocks
now check it,
the legendary Phoenix Mitchell put it down
so tough they had to make a movie about the town
but called it Nino Brown
That bullshit New Jack City
is really based upon this place we call Crack City
Oakland, Cali we act shitty
think crack's the answer
to get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers
Smokin' blow and takin (???) like Jo-Jo Dancer
Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control
like Tony Montana
house in Atlanta
3-car garage
our ghetto superstars was hard
young niggas touch a mil-ticket
before they life behind bars
niggas get caught with like eighty kilos
hidden in the wall
but shit ain't hidden at all
from these cocaine sniffin dogs
same with the law
shit in your draws when they get your ass
and let the ballers ball, get the cash
till they get to your ass
I've never seen a baller fall on his knees
and snitch so fast
plea bargain run after them niggas
that hang out with your ass
no wonder why that bitch-ass nigga got out
so quick, so fast
came on the block my niggas saw you
choppin' it up with task
now that's a violation
nigga can't chop it up with task
so while the trial awaits
some nigga walks up and pumped his ass
Because the niggas in the O are hard as f*ck
we sell peruvian flake, get it powdered, or rocked up
don't want nothin from life but to retire from the game
motherfuckin city of cocaine,

city of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right
the city of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right

Verse 2:
 
them task folks can't stop us
high school niggas get caught with a hundred G's
stashed in his locker along with a chopper
niggas be ballin like a doctor, or a surgeon
M.C. Hammer splurgin'
he bought up countless brand new helicopters
and suburbans, now he hurtin
the feds spilled they base downtown
so now its curtains
Niggas be perpin' off
certain it's gon' be a sweep
dope feind came through last week
told me its gonna be a sweep
1991's the number nigga
end of the summer
niggas ain't ridin no fuckin hummers
we ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder
I wonder, wonder what they would do
to a nigga who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder
straight from Humboldt county, f*ck that brown
weed all should be green like the jungle
dope fiends tryin to warn us
settin' up scene still in a bundle
we beat they ass and drag them from they hair
just like repunzel
don't f*ck up our hustle
But anyway the day came just as predicted
I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin early morning pissin'
pulled down my britches, and a nigga almost shitted
I heard somebody walkin on the roof
I cocked the fo-fitness
woke my cousin Mike up
could be some niggas sent to strike us
cause back then so many niggas didn't like us
looked out the window, all I saw 
was FBI and snipers
I let the china white flush
and put that motherfucking 4-5 up
see the dope fiend he informed us
told us its gonna be a sweep and then
he tried to warn us
but niggas out here try to make they money
so we 'nourmous
then only a battering ram
bustin down your shit, 'nourmous
highway patrols, 5.0's, ambulance and coroners
in case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance
by 9:00 they lock down each baller from every corner
from north to west on down to east Oakland California
but, but, them niggas from the O is hard as f*ck
we sell Peruvian flake powder or get it rocked up
want nothing in life but to retire from the game
with some change in the city of cocaine,

In their face cause I'm fed up with that same ol' crap 
Lack of developing your crew that's why your stage show's wack! 

So let the sleeping and assuming and the B.S. stop 
Because, Naughty is to live and die for Hip Hop and I'm VinRock. 
I'm holdin' down the fort around my block 
I reign in this game jackin'other people's props 
Many crews only stress me 
Petty fools try to test me 
Very few impress me, bless me 
I sneeze upon the wack 
No one but us could do it like that to me the rest's considered scrap 
Fact: Naughty niggas will never be defeated 
Come and try word God, word to life, I put that on the double I.

Clap long and steady til your palm's sore & sweaty

Shorty taking tall mics so practice saying alright

Pass the ball all in the back head towards the front cause the wall

I might make moves and motions 
Start a crammed commotion 
Make kitties and titties in the city glow like lotion 
Remember freestyles where freebies 
systems still sound like CB's, leat tracks leave them wheaties 
I'm greedy, can't see me 
Wit bifoc's I fry then fly folks with high hopes 
Watch my smoke now why choke 
Sly stroke get by nope now negro 
You were, dead-ass wrong 
Head too strong

You could walk a mile in my shoes, but could not
Mope around for a day in my socks, wakin' up
Coughin' up a whole range of crap
Coffee mug, 'World's Greatest Dad'
Livin' life in a bathrobe or some cargo's
On borrowed time, worry lines like a barcode
Wearin' my Chicago Bears cap, feelin' like Clark
My family fillin' my heart, I try to do right
(Oh) Try to do good
I try to do the best I can, man, all of my life
(Oh) I've done all I could
To try and be a better man, but I've realised
Hey, I gotta be clever now
(Hey) I gotta go get it now

Pays the bills, has a travel plan, a caravan
That way it feels like everywhere that I am
Trouble follows till I unravel and crash the van
Always managin' in damage control
Count my blessings like casualties and add up the toll
And matters resolve, I plan on gettin' back to my goals
But this life a getaway, so grab on and hold
When I'm away (oh) this world leads me astray
Everything starts breakin' apart, so I'm spendin' my days
(Oh) Tryna carve out a place
That'll fill that empty space in my heart
To say that I'm a beautiful mess, I'd say the truth is a stretch
I confess I'm only human, but I'm doin' my best
Uncertain if all the hurtin' is worth it
Yeah, I know I couldn't be further from perfect

But sometimes I feel
I make a mess of things

Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas

"I was wayward child 
With the weight of the world 
That I held deep inside 
Life was a winding road 
And I learned many things 
Little ones shouldn't know 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Funny how one can learn 
To grow numb to the madness 
And block it away 
I left the worst unsaid 
Let it all dissipate 
And I try to forget 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child falling inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 

Guardian angel I 
Sail away on an ocean 
With you by my side 
Orange clouds roll by 
They burn into your image 
And you're still alive 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raise my head to the sky 
And though time rolls by 
Still feel like a child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon",Close My Eyes,Rap

The more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin care of ya check nigga

To get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt

Strike like a brightness, a light, I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, ya know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing

"Take this for example young brothers want rep
Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent, pull a screwdriver, and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets

Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be weilding
Got the tec one dealing, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
Anf f*ck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so Imma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the GangStarr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets",Code of the Streets,Rap

Coca latte damned to make ya heart stop
And now the haters hot, so they run and tell the cops
They shut us down, we set up shop on another block

We gotta get it, baby.

Sharp and on point, f*ck the tricks of the government
Money rules the world, watch my people suffering
Cops busting in, handcuffing men 'til they wrist bleed
Some read what they don't need, give to seed
Black, Lebanese, rabbis in green fatigues
Microphone masked emcees, Maccabees
Hard head emcees get told and still they freeze
The truth came in flesh but still you don't believe
The best thing you know is the spots to find weed
Get the knowledge dungarees, we still struggling

In my lifestyle of hard times and good times
Stood mine with the wines, became nice with the mind
Born intelligent, f*ck elegant, I represent
For the ladies and gents, delinquents and presents
Everyday hungry, gun play on the sunny
Crews sweeter than honey, stars f*ck for all they money
Stupid dummies, fifteen slugs flood the tummy
Thugs rapped like mummies, sipping Remy's
The clip empty, feeling shifty, swifty
Highly intoxicated, simply infatuated
Never thought he could be faded
Up in the hospital, critical, eating pickles
With no teeth, back on the streets he got beef for little Keith and Tariff
A walking death wish, living selfish, I sort of felt this
The fifth of September, he felt helpless and breathless

[Chorus: x3]

Today, life, shoot out, a dice game, bank loot out
Jewels out, laying on three hundred dollar sweaters
Tools out, last day schools out, nine birettas and better
Carry the eighth or red leather, timberland weather gear
Hands in the air, this is a stick up, don't play for hiccups
You won't need a body pick-up, money in the laundry bag
Hungry comrades get they guns from Arabs
With the loot that they had, they rob more victims on the av.
Today cash, examples of the program

Go and drop the top, you can feel the breeze
30 in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
It just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions but you better not tell 'em
Girl I'm 'bout to f*ck it up, I brought a light 10
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
""Ay bro pull up. Whatchu in?"" In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer

Get-get that Cookie money, on my Oakland shit
40 on a nigga, I'll blow this bitch
When I shoot, I don't miss or I net that bitch
F*ck her quick on the first night, I barely met that bitch
Too much money on me, bring that firepower
Knife on that chopper, they think Michael Myers got 'em
The rap fold, I'ma go platinum still
'Cause I put my deal money in the blow, crack and pills
I'm from Detroit baby, that's a wild city
Hop on at yo block party and give that crowd 50
Aye Dex, when I hear that ""huh"", I know I hit it
I still f*ck with Paid Will, Dada winnin'
Peezy and Pay, let's come together, this our city
Jeezy in the A, he f*ck with Meech, that's our nigga
Rest in Peace to Great Lake ruler Darnell Lindsay
Still hit the kitchen to whip, Chef Boyar-Grizzley (Detroit!)

Go and drop the top, you can feel the breeze
30 in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze

F*ck the world  word up 
Sunz of Man  Method Man  True Mast'  collabora tion 

[Chorus] 
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs 
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood 
Because is you down or are you down just because 
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs 

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact 
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat 
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom 
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms 
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me 
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me 
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip 
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man 
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law 
True Master in this hardcore Art of War 
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense 
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense 
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force 
And exhaust your whole supply 
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain 
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter 

Shots in the park, it be on after dark 
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook 
When push come to shove, we push through the club 
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub 
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze 
Recognize your friends from your foes 
Or here lie, another one victimized 
Left for The Fly, now what size is this? 
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged 
To get a fatter piece of that pie 
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria 
I will survive, at war with the warrior 
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies 
Turn the heat up, and bend me 
Prepare for the next milleni' 
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep 
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat 
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from 
Same shit different slum, where we about to go 
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice 
When we done, and all minds are one, yo 

[Chorus] 

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise 
New York state side to the West side 
F*ck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here 
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb 
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth 
I translate til the land quake 
I plan my escape on the good fan base 
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape 
No copy or biting off of what your man make 
It's 1998, get your own mindstate 
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes 
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs? 
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord 
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore 
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours 
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors 
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work 
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt 
Uhh, what 
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs? 

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom 
? of Islam, keeps me calm 
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam 
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm 
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm 
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed 
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead 
? , hangin fast on they deathbed 
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals 
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole 
You want to battle, I separate your Adam's Apple 
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo 
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks 
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack 

[Chorus] 

Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from 
Same shit different slum, where we about to go 
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice

"REFRAIN
Pour que ça sonne funk
Laisse-moi sampler do funk
Tout d'abord, une première mise au point
Un simple rappel
Je ne suis en aucun cas politicien
Tout au plus chroniqueur, simple reporter
Tuant dans l'?uf le virus de la rumeur
Ceci étant dit, là n'est pas mon seul hobby
Je suis aussi fier de faire partie de la clique
Des MC's au style atypique, qui choque
Vivant au rythme de la musique de notre époque
Le rythme est soûl, jazz ou funkadéklic
Je glisse mes rimes dessus de façon magnifique
See'est clair, Je dirais même see'est limpide
Comme une coupure cool Shen, come again come
REFRAIN
Systématiquement pris par l'envie
D'un instant funky
Non pas de facétie
Mais plutôt de la basse
Un riddim qui tabasse
Manettes à fond, ça décrasse
Et crée de l'espace
See'est la thérapie que je suis de puis tout petit
Sans comprendre, j'en étais déjà épris
J'en avait déjà l'envie
Ne me doutant pas que ceci tracerait ma vie
Me permettant d'échapper à l'ennui
J'en ai pour toute une vie, so funky
Qui, qui je suis ?
Quoi ! Vous ne m'avez toujours pas remis ?
Moi, gardien de sa survie pour toute la décennie
Moi, contre la perfidie qui jette le discrédit
L'infra-soul, l'infra-jazz, l'infra-funk
Vous avez dit funk ?
Et là je reviens comme un tank
Sur ce groove qui tonne
Voici le new gorgon
Quoiqu'il advienne
Il come and again come
REFRAIN
Mais quoi ? Quoi, qu'entends-je ?
D'où veinent ces critiques comme quoi le sample serait le sida de la musique
?
Diagnostic morbide anachronique et stupide
Emanant sûrement d'un looser marqué par les rides
Bon, trêve de plaisanterie, je veux do funk
Je veux que ça swingue hardcore, si possible
Donc mettez de côté le côté borné qui vous caractérise
Le rap est un bol d'air pur, un coup de brise phénoménal
Un coup de fouet monumental
Deux cas de figure, bien sûr, le bien le mal
Certains critiquent, d'autres plus malins prennent nos techniques
Même Mick Jagger a fait un hit avec un funky beat
Alors qui conteste et qui change de bord ?
A l'heure où des rock-stars évitent la mise à mort
Grâce notamment à l'apport do sampler dès lors
Le Hip Hop prend sa place et se révèle encore
Beaucoup plus créatif dans tous les domaines
Que ce soit des textes free ou des textes à thème
J'aime quand la mélodie m'amène sur des rythmes funky comme
Come again come",Come Again,Rap
"Comin at you 
Come again
(repeat 3)

I'm on the refirst verse yo I'm comin kinda swift 
Bust the lyric and the lyric that goes like this 
I can flow with the best and keep a crowd jumpin 
Like the niggaz for life and we always into something 
Star takes it away little G's got to have it 
Now its back to the lab so I can start bamalamin 
'Cause Toss is like kick it and I love to eat chicken 
From south with applause and the nine is straight clickin 
M dogs Hip hogs its a sucker free movement 
Yo Pete what up T show these suckers how its done G 
Get up on the mic and bust a funky ragamuffin

[Chorus]

Me come again me comin comin again 
Me comin at you so hard you say please come again 
Me ragamuffin rappen and me come a little faster 
So pass the raster to the ganja master puff puff puff

In 1991 I had to get out of the dope game 
I'm slangin weed and a little bit of cocaine 
Just pushin rocks on the corner on a park bench 
I made a lot of dollars but it didn't make cents 
Its easy money cause the hogs are highly organized 
One hit and a smoker stays hypnotized 
They come again comin again and its a pity 
'Cause now their all chinked out like blinky in new jack city 
They try to quit but then the hitter calls them back 
So they say don't come come near me no more 
Don't come near me no more I don't want no crack 
This smokin fantasy makes me feel irate 
Sticky sesamea pipe may we love gonjie 
So pass me the spliff and you know that I be token 
I couldn't keep track of all the weed I'm smokin 
They ask me will I quit I say you must be jokin 
'Cause I'll be smokin till my funky brain is broken 
And even then you know I still won't be the end 
Cause me comin at you so hard you tell me please come again

[Chorus]

Its been a long time comin so punks start runnin 
And if you cross my line you bet your ass will be gunnin 
I gonna rap hoes right next to the sewer 
Call me brother black hip hop contersuer 
Ground bracken fanatic Quban Asiatic 
And if you want beef I'll give you asmastatic 
A mover and a shaker big time a money maker 
I'll make you follow me and I'm out of here later 
Before I make and exit my microphone I check it 
Then I put down the mic cause I'm microphone reckless 
Now hold up just a second cause this is for the record 
And when I swing my thing then all the honey girls get naked 
Then its like my duty to grab some naked booty 
But I always flash the latex when I'm sexin up a cutie 
'Cause I'm the horny man the freakin reakin Mexican 
And me comin at you so hard you say please come again 

[Chorus]",Come Again,Rap
"Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are getting intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, (Yeah you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't, (Yeah thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home
That way you could be prepared, maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me",Come and See Me,Rap
