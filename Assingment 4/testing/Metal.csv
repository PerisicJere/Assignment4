"One woman down my street is too hot for the average man
Hard to handle, a fire in her eyes
Wants the hot rocks right in her hand
I know she's burning, hot with love
A come-on look and she ain't fooling
And she knows just what it does
She gave me a number to make me feel fine
Said call me up baby
It's gonna 9.5. - N.A.S.T.Y.
You're everything I need
'Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please
N.A.S.T.Y., you're everything I need
'Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please

Ooh - no mama's baby, this child
She's a killer wrapped in high-heel shoes
Touch the skin - it burns like fire
I don't even care if I'm being used
Threw me down and then she tore off my jeans
She said, come on, babe, I mean business
I'm gonna show you what liberated means

Do it to me baby
I'm losing my mind
Said call me up honey
Tonight I'm 9.5. - N.A.S.T.Y.
You're everything I need
'Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please
N.A.S.T.Y., you're everything I need
'Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please

Some bad habits are hard to break
Like an earthquake coming
I got to shake, shake, shake

9.5. - N.A.S.T.Y.
You're everything I need
'Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please",9.5. - N.A.S.T.Y.,Metal
"I'm twenty six years old - please tell me what have I got
A monopoly on misery - I guess that's my lot
Ten years of eating bullshit leaves it's taste in your mouth
And I think the time has come for me to spit it all out...

'Cause at the end of the tunnel I see
A dole-queue that's beckoning me.

Yes living hand-to-mouth it can be fun for a while
Simple things please simple minds - do you see me smile?
I've broke my bread and fishes - turned my water to wine
But I'm sick of walking tightrope on the poverty line
I left my home and family - I've pawned all my dreams
Took a second mortgage on my soul to further my schemes
Now my body's in the pages of ""exchange and mart""
Ten pounds or nearest offer for one slightly broken heart.

And at the end of the rainbow I found
A crock of shit there on the ground.

Have you had a bellyful of emptiness
Do you feel like me we're all just wasting our time
If it's true inside each cloud's a silver lining
Why does it shine on other lives but not on mine?
I've had a bellyful of emptiness
I've got a pocketful of nothing at all
In real-life fairy tales the frog stays a frog
And the serving girl can't be the belle of the ball.

You're not the belle of the ball
Get back in your cinders and crawl

How many other fools like me
Have lost their lives contractually
Believing there must be far more
Than nine to five - the factory floor?
Have countless thousands watched their dreams
Corrupted into things obscene
By money minded bastards who
Don't give a damn for me or you?

Now my wallet's getting thinner like the hair on my head
By the time I hit the ""big Time"" I'll be buried and dead
Tell me how can you resent me for the money I've spent
On the only habit I indulge (that's paying the rent)?
No-one said this life was easy Christ I've known that all along
But it needn't be this difficult that's why I wrote this song
The sex and drugs and rock 'n 'roll were never meant to last
And the bailiffs knocking on your door don't need a backstage pass!

Be sure that you read between their lines
There are claws in the contracts we sign.

Have you had a bellyful of emptiness
Do you feel like me we're all just wasting our time
If it's true inside each cloud's a silver lining
Why does it shine on other lives but not on mine?
I've had a bellyful of emptiness
I've got a pocketful of nothing at all
In real-life fairy tales the frog stays a frog
And the serving girl can't be the belle of the ball.",A Bellyful of Emptiness,Metal
"Mucha, mucha policía por las calles todo el día
Buscando delincuentes que no están entre la gente
Entre la gente, entre la gente, entre la gente
Políticos mamones que nos tocan los cojones
Vendiendo un futuro que no vale ni un duro
Ni un duro, ni un duro

No se que puedo hacer
No se que puedo hacer
No se que puedo hacer
No se que puedo hacer

Na, na, y yo aquí, ¡Si!,  Jugándome la vida
Na, na, a cara o cruz, ¡A cara o cruz!

Tipos tristes de traje gris por las calles de Madrid
Trabajando como hormigas para irse a las Malvinas
A las Malvinas, a las Malvinas, a las Malvinas

Y yó que puedo conseguir, no me gusta
lo que hay aquí
Nunca encuentro lo que busco y
Lo que busco no lo encuentro

"Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it out on me

I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

I was walking down among the graves
I heard a cry, my shadow is gone
Emptiness in my body, I felt so alone
Small black wings on my naked back
Now guess what I saw on one of the stones
I saw my soul, in a magical haze
It was all dressed up as a corpse in a wedding dress
Small black wings on my naked back
Now hear my prayer, beggin' for mercy
I'm living to die

Satan has taken his toll.",A Corpse Without Soul,Metal
"Tonight the circle is meeting again
Who will be the first to fall in trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight the spirit will glance
So as they're approaching ghostly hour
Seven people here are joining hands
They think they know the spirit to appear
Contact, the table starts to dance
Time is standing still
It's a dangerous meeting
They're gonna get themselves killed

Tonight the circle is broken forever
Seven people dead within a trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight seven souls are reaching hell
Time was standing still
The meeting is over
Their journey is on
Oh, they should have known
Not to play with the powers of Hell
Some people have lost their way
Some people have lost their mind",A Dangerous Meeting,Metal
"The livelong day there's a voice in my cry
Growing like fire, (it brings) scorn to my smile
Time lengthens the night, and shortens the day
The ghosts I host don't seem to go away

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone 

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone 

A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 

Laws dissolve to reveal wonder
As they open up to pull me under
And I will put my terms to the test
To put the ghost to rest

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked

"Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground

Oh, I hear you say
That is the way of the world
No, hear what I say
I wanna do so much in my way

Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burnin' so hot in my head

Oh, I hear you say
That is the way of the world

"I don't know what to do I don't know who you are I'm calling from the silence 
We have gone too far
I try to understand you, your life has been so cruel 
Please try to see it my way I've got something to say
All those years were not in vain 
Even though there was much pain I try to learn from my mistakes 
I want to make it up to you
A million light years away from you
I am
A million light years away from you
I hope that you'd respect my honesty and faith and maybe you'd forgive me

For what I did to you I'll get on with my life I hope you do that too

In blindness and decay
The circle's been closed, now
My song of the end

I've seen it all
Listen crowd
I'll tell you everything
Though I have to say

I don't know much
Talking about a past
And future secret
Most called him once

And future king
Far back in the past
I saw his ending
Long before it started

I knew his name
He's the one who took the sword
Out of the stone
It's how that ancient tale began

I hear it in the cold winds
My song of the end
I had seen it in my dreams
My song of the end

I can't stop the darkening clouds
I feel cold
When I cry out for the bark
Take him back to Avalon

Dwell on for a new age
So long sleep well my friend
Take him back to Avalon
I will wait and guard

The future king's crown

It was nice but now it's gone
My song of the end

It was fixed the whole time
My song of the end
I saw it all",A Past & Future Secret,Metal
"Reflecting ourselves in the blood of all the beings we slay
Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain
There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold
This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away

The way we all behave is not understandable
It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away
We all behave like children, taking off the head of our
Teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back

We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil
We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other
Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession
And there is so much time to kill

The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm walking, standing on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side

The way I see myself, so confused, so sophisticated
I have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore

You burn yourself, set fire for your own good
We die eyes closed, dig your own grave now
Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame

Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame
Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth
The giant snake is coming down to eat our heads
And the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under

The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm living, dying on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side

The way I see myself, so confused, so sophisticated
Don't have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore, try not to get it anymore
Try not to get it anymore, try not to get it anymore",A Sight To Behold,Metal
"You mesmerize slowly
Till i can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right

Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear

I'm so afraid
But i still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know i want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance

A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in

I'm so afraid
But i still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know i want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire

Preying deep from within

"Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became

My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

Je dois partir
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred

"This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

I don't want this dream or the grievance it brings
Can't justify greed at the cost of equality
Tangled in endless archaic chains 
Of power, profit, gain
What about the poor bearing poverty's marks
What about the sick whose lives are torn apart
What about those whose rights aren't respected
A nation of youth dejected

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage

A burdened soul once searching for liberty
Crowned in debt as the new face of slavery
Died by design with a senseless hope 
And a never ending rope
What about the leaders abusing authority
Corrupt moral compass guarded bureaucracy
What about those who died so we can live our complacency must end

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage
This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

Spirits of the slain hiding in the corners of my mind
Screaming when I kneel to look inside 
Stomach fucking turning and now it's disconcerting
Fight fire with fire you'll see everyone's burning

Turn on the TV for the murder spree
Get distracted while they take your civil liberty
Thoughts and prayers again, is that what it'll take?
Which industries profit while lives are at stake 

Now hear the media fools discuss the killer's mind
Starring at the screen to tell us what they find
Manifesto, dollar, worship get on your knees
So they can sell us a cure for the American disease

It's time to rethink this dream that they call American
Corrupt system of beliefs, some will call their heritage
It's time to rethink this dream that they call American

"There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall

Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away

Than surrender to the secret

You'd better stick around until you're on the way

"I step from door to door
My mind's misguided
Keep moving on and on forevermore

Was it real what I saw in the mirror?
Was it fear when the end got clearer?

Now as my time's passing by
What am I waiting for?

Who'll grant me wings to fly?
And will I have another try?

'Cause I would not miss my moment again
Yes, I would not miss this moment my friend

No one knows the answer
What could have been
The edge I still fear
The roads they're leading nowhere
There is no end
Oh gods be with me
Carry me along 
In blindness I tried to march on 
Mystified me
Yes, it fooled me

No surrender 
Don't surrender
I hear them calling
I hear them calling
Can hear them scream
Don't be late when aeons pass
Your memories will fade
Even the purest one might fail
Here and deceive
The righteous soul
And then their world will come undone

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once more they return, they will save us all
Now break through

Recall the eclipse
There is none who survive
Defeat, defeat, defeat
There's no more
You've searched for the answer
The answer is creed
They're real no more
You cannot get over

My light shall shine forever
The Nine beyond the wall
They're turning
They're burning
They now understand
I soon will seal all doors
Their stars won't shine here anymore
Their savior won't even try
He can't remember the truth
My words become real
And there's nothing they can do

They may follow a plan they once had
Deeply sad
They have chosen the wrong side and tried to resist
All their visions and music no longer exist
When the morrow will come it shall all be
In between the realms, in between the realms they might move on

That's when all pureness dies in vain
There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return they will save us all
Now break through

Will I 
Yes, will I fail to believe, my friend?
What if it's all done in vain?

Don't be afraid
Will it be me they blame?
See, it's a whole world that I've once condemned
And I shattered it all with a thought as it seems
But it all has been me as the mirror has revealed
Now reveal
Now redeem
I will carry the storm (the savior's coming home)
Yes, I'll carry the grail and I'll wash away the pain

There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return they will save us all
Now break through

I don't look back
There's more in me
My hour shall come
The old gods are calling
Then straight ahead
A door appears
The tyrant must go down
That's when the ancient gods return (they will return)",At the Edge of Time,Metal
"Si he de naufragar en mi tormenta 
Déjame nadar dentro de ti

Recita poemas el adiós 
Se maquilla la melancolia 
Con nostalgia y polvos de dolor 

Mas allá del sol y las estrellas 
O entre las esquinas de tu amor 
Puede que encontremos otra tierra 
Pues la profecía empieza

El infierno se enfrío

De una telaraña gris 
De nubes y dolor 

Vomitaba un volcan

Se enquistó la primavera

Ya no queda ningún recuerdo 
Fotogramas del ayer 
Quiero encarcelar tus besos 
En la celda de tu querer 

Ya no quedan sueños que difícil es 
Dibujar sonrisas en el corazón 
Ya no queda nadie con quien naufragar 
Solo queda el ayer 

Animas en comunión
Reunión del mas allá 
Convocados por satán
Que no para de llorar

Hay veces que no se 
Si exprimir el sol 
Para sentir calor 

Durante miles de años, los seres humanos 
Hemos podido disfrutar, del mejor regalo 
Que los dioses dieran jamás a ningún ser vivo 

La brisa, el viento, el hermano sol y la hermana luna 
Campos y praderas donde ver crecer a nuestros hijos 
Amaneceres bañados con el perfume que estornudan las flores en primavera 
Puestas de sol decoradas por los sueños aun por concebir 
Y aunque parezca mentira inteligencia 

Pero el hombre blanco despreció aquel tesoro 
Y a medida que la vida le sonreía
El le contestaba dando patadas al destino 

Si alguien lee esta carta, no olvide que el fin de esta civilización 
Se debió al egoísmo, codicia e incultura de la raza humana 

Los hombres ya no somos mamíferos 
El ser humano no se convirtió en depredador 
La raza humana somos simplemente un virus 
Matamos, crecemos, y nos multiplicamos 

Por eso nos extinguimos 
Por eso las aguas se tragaron nuestra civilización 
La verdadera atlántida, éramos nosotros 

Y por eso hemos escrito esta nota

Se escupen a si mismos",Atlantia,Metal

My hollow eyes see but cannot see
I stare deep into the glowing inferno
The loss I feel is breaking me

I heard their screams
Through flaming walls
Walls, I could not tear down
I could not help them

Helplessly I watched my life go up in flames

I pull the sword from the glowing fire
And hammer-beat in on the anvil

Forging it with rage and hate
I will seal my enemy's fate

I ingrave the blade with magic runes
And summon Gods by sacrifice in blood
Pure blue hate shines within this sword
his magic sword will cut only once

No sword has ever been like this one
The Avenger is its name

Now my sworn enemy
Vengeance will belong to me
A year has gone by
Now my sworn enemy
It's your turn to die
It's your turn to die!

The sword cuts through his throat
His head tumbles to the ground
The headless body lays gently down
Down to sleep in a pool of blood

The Avenger has lost its shine
The magic is now drained
Dull and useless it rests in my hand
Its purpose is soon fulfilled

Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
So I turn the blade around
And run it through my stomach veins
And I fall to the ground",Avenger,Metal

Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods

They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

Deep into my room
At your future and freedom

And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

"I'm Obscure, the shadow black
Alone I walk on the shunned path
Centuries mine, reveal the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Material world, nothing to me now
I am one with the darkness
Seek not the light

Alien core, light is not for me
Free in the dark with the coffin worm
Survived alone in the world's dusk
Your gods are dead, earth buried them

Riding the night wind
Soar above the tombs
Of sorcerers departed and towers burned
Doom has taken shape and sealed Earth's fate
Still I live strange years
Stand beneath the stars

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Recall years when the worlds sailed
Darkling tides in crimson skies
In galleries ever I search
For haunted crypts where no lamp burns

Lurking in the cavern deep within the mind
Crowning the throne of dreams with the blackened gems
Dwelling in the towers both ruined and vast
I am he who returns when the scythe shall fall

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Once I sough the shape of the world around me
Once I dreamed I'd walk the common path
Once I let the weakened minds disguise me
Once I thought I lost my outer shell

Dark world is rising
The sky is black
The light of day's not coming back

I'm the night, my visions dark
Alone I tread the ancient track
Centuries mine, learned from the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Finding the release in the cosmic scheme
Welcome the exile from those they called men

Your loneliness and your guilt inside.

Oh so don't pay no mind

It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad

Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again

"Let there be darkness
Let there be blood tonight
Let there be riots
Come start the fires tonight

Can't you see, our people have got no choice
But to fight them back
Can't you see, the change of consciousness
Demands a total attack
Total attack
Total... attack!

Finally they're swarming in a long forgotten youth
The cause of inequality, a paradise for few
Superior, inferior, a vast insanity
When justice is tyranny
Anarchy is breaking out, destruction marks it's way
Burning temples turning into dark crypts of decay
The mighty are the fallen now, the weak are on the hunt
Battle on many fronts

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
Now let the riots begin
Convulsed by protest
And civilization collapse

Monumental terror spreading like a pestilence
From suburbs to the center of colossal arrogance
Cascade of aggression merely harvest seeds of hate
Storming the barricades
Cities of inception burn into the ashes in one night
Imperators crying at this grand historic sight
Entering a death spiral, tonight they see their fate
Doomed to reincarnate

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
So let the riots begin
A social unrest
And civilization collapse",Civilization Collapse,Metal

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, and stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkend grave?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?  No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?  No I'll never feel the same

I know I've been so hard on you; I know I've told you lies

To whom it may concern.

I am scared to death. 9 years ago they finally let me out, and I
was just beginning to feel better. I am not Myself any longer.
I guess You could not even recognize My face if You saw Me now.
That phone call 2 hours ago has torn Me apart. It was Grandma.
She invited Me back to the old house. I do not want to go back,
but I must. Maybe You will understand My fear if I tell
You what happened during My childhood.

18 years ago I was living with My mother and
My sister Missy in Grandma's old house. I had
been told that Grandma was away on a long vacation,
and that she would soon return. She did.

I have later found out that she was actually being released
from that same asylum. ""She's insane"", they said, when she
kept on babbling about ""THEM"". I still cannot make up
My mind about who really did separate Grandpa's head
from his shoulders. You see, ""THEY"" were always so
nice to Me.

Anyway, time is short and I must leave for the old
house. So here is what happened 18 years ago. And
in case we never see each other again, at least You
will know why.

And I can't rebound from the impact

Of blood, coloured by extremity
Oxygenates the muscles as they rile
And breed rage out of cavity

And carry me into an earthly hell
To the bottom of the crater's void

"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire I followed them 
Into the middle I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
Drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more

Now when your spirit is free

Fading light
Disappearing light
Tells you darkness is to come
Ancient rites

Has never revealed where you will go
You will enter realms where angels fear to tread
Open hidden doors within your mind

Sail with Charon sail into destiny
Accept your death and make it to your own choice

"Why do I keep on doing this? It's not for me anymore
I'm doing this more for you than I
And on that lonely road to nowhere
I lost myself to something else

I don't know where I'm going or where I've been
It's so hard to remember all the things I am, am I?
It feels like the end is near, catching up with me
Catch me if you can, cause I'm going down into the ground

How much longer can I keep going on?
I can feel my lost ones coming down
Sooner than later I'll see you all again
I feel my purpose here slipping away
I see the sun, but it's raining

I hope I'm on my way to better things
And if I'm not, it doesn't really matter
Cause I am doing this more for you than I am me
I can no longer pretend, that my life is worth living
I, I would rather die, be dead again

Hold on
Now here it comes, death for one, for a lonely son
Up then down. I'm spinning around
My soul is so confused again
Am I floating towards the sun?
Hold on, am I dead on?

Through a tunnel of black, why?
Why do I feel so sad?

I've been waiting for the end of act 9 to come
The curtain must fall, the end of a song

But the song goes on and on
The light is so very strong
I'm drifting along, I have no will

I'm drifting still
In a room without walls, I feel the chill
No one is here to pick me up
Nothingness, what a mess, oh
Is anybody there?

Is anybody there? I'm talking to you, do you hear me?
If I could only see through the wall of nothingness
The wall of black
They gave me number 9, this is not like last time
Number 9
This time I am really losing my mind

I hear an orchestra, I see an orchestra
I greet an orchestra, I meet an orchestra
I'm in an orchestra, I am an orchestra
I kill this orchestra, I kill me? No
No don't stop, oh please don't stop

Hey say here, what's going on?, hey wait for me

I'm running but I can't keep up
Then I realize my feet are gone
This is such a weird weird song
The orchestra is now a door
One is one and two is four. I can see three more
Seven doors, seven doors
I must choose one before they're gone

But I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
But I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
The number 6-6, the number 6-6-6
The number 6-6-6

The number 6-6-6, that's my door
Wuauuu, look at all the colours
There goes an orchestra, no more doors
Close the window, here they come
I hear another end of this song
But again the song goes on

Dead again. I know cause I've been here before
I'm dead again, if I could only reach that door
The number 6-6-6, the number 6-6-6

I'm beginning to miss you again
Why can't I just get you out of my mind, 
I must forget

Dead again. I know cause I've been here before

"An outlaw walking through the valley of men
Glared with a sunken eye of death
Moved his head from side to side and said
Come on you gutless slugs fight like a man
State your name and business and let's see what you got
Another body for the hangman's count
Show me the bar, and show me the cards
Hold on to your guys

Filled up with bug juice
The moon shine in his hand
Hot headed with a temperament
The speediest deadliest man with a gun
A bloody gambler but a gentleman dog
A frontier vagabond who charms all the dames
Hello ladies how's your day today
Let me introduce you to myself

Ooooooooooh the outlaw man's roar

A friendly man but without a friend
Fort Griffin Texas here I am
Supported Wyatt Earp to the very end
Cemented brotherhood
Don't get in his way
You cannot shake his boots
You cannot scare his fate
Down under you will hear him grin
Great the man the outlaw himself

"Come to the reaper sing the song, bringing death to everyone
Once the earth was calm and safe, but now the land's a battle place
Firing shells into the air, where they land, no-one cares
Now the blood flows like a stream, widowmaker reigns supreme

Dogs of war, no surrender (*)
Dogs of war, I kill the defender
Dogs of war, Scream into battle
Dogs of war, it's the day of the jackal

Nothing seems to ease the pain, the reaper's shadow still remains
Sniper lets the bullet fly, in the distance someone die
The town becomes an empty shell, come and spend a day in hell
Forgotten what we're fighting for, no-one wins this bloody war

That you'll pay in the end

And manipulates the will to be

How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy

On the wall

Into your soul

A now blacked heart
Is reaching out in divinity
Body's suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty

Marks the demise of you life.

Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

Ruins my future destiny

Pull up these string ties chasing me

No one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hairpin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fight against your failure, and living on his knees
Guilty of a crime of nonconformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty

A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn't work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there
Coroner never checked, because he didn't fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believe he died
Starting up the hearse, now for a final drive

Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night
It's a fatal illusion to think that evil never dies

In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes
Spilling all their blood was a promise that he'd keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep
Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree
A butcher, hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave

You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Is it a hand on your shoulder from the lord above
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove

"In the days when lands were few,
And man sometimes had no chance
But sell his soul to his landlord to make a living
In far and away country,
They gave acres of land away for free,
To all able to claim it
Ships sailed across the great seas,
Fortunes were made and dreams shattered
Sometimes couples were torn apart,
For all they could afford, was one ticket.

Leaving my life behind
My young love and the unborn
Only have a lock of her hair
And burning love inside

After forty work-filled days and sleepless nights,
The sails are lit by the lights of Boston
And here we go
Off the ship! towards the adventure,
The one to define our lives.
Daily grind and a tiny room.

I got here safe, love.
I have an address, until spring, then I shall race for the land,
Hope to hear from you soon

Her letter reads

Please let me know everything's alright
Thinking about you, though you're out of sight
Every night, when I'm turning in, my tears find me.
Please hurry, dear, come back and rescue me

Now that I have made the dollars we need for the dream.
The best horse I've ever seen,
A carriage and everything I need
I will make my way to the great unknown
Every moment I wish you were here with me now

Please let me know everything's alright

No, I'm not a stranger, among the people in here
Yet I have never felt so alone
At high noon the sound will boom,
And I will start racing for the
Land we can call home.

I stuck my
Flag in the ground, screaming 'n shouting,
I've never felt so proud, love!
We are free from eternal serfdom!
I'm gonna bring you home, my light!

Nine, eight, seven, six, counting the days. solo!
Five, four, three, two, together forever! solo!

I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
I am the land and the land is me
Freedom is everything and we are free

"As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
and you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honor.

The smell of resigned leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he knew
To fear no mortal man
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honor.",Flash of the Blade,Metal

In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near

It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread

Who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare

To follow their heart, and not follow their fear

You just see what you don't have

About what is happening

One question remains
And I'd like to hear your answer

Acting on target
At robotic speed
Recklessly feeding
Your robotic needs

No minute wasted
Emotions refused
Your brain's exploited
Your heart remains unused

It seems we all...
Name your price
How much is it to buy your loyalty
I'll do so, if I can afford

Name your price
How much do you charge to show remorse
To throw your indifference overboard

Won't you once
Think just a little while about
What you will leave behind
When you decease

Won't you once
Just once be good for something
Good for someone
Good for yourself at least

All I knew and all I believed
Crumbling images

Scramble to reach higher ground,

Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine

You've lost the sense

No one really knows Which way the wind blows
One day the tides will turn One day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn The fury of out maker's hand
Man is a mistake cast out Shunned and cast down Giving life through breathe of gods W With itself always at odds The pious the preacher The liar, the creature F rom rock to fire The dust of man

Now we don't
We're floating around
In the unknown zone

Shooting for the sky
Reaching out to catch
A piece of Paradise

Or just imaginations
Visions twist around my mind
And brings me shelter from the night

Where do we go from here
When do we finally disappear

Is it heaven
Is it hell
Is it the afterworld
Or just something else
Are we prisoners in Nowhereland
Where darkness is your only friend
Kept inside this wall of sleep
Have we fallen into a deep freeze

Left the wastelands
Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life
Where dreams become reality

In troubled times
We saw the writing on the wall
We heard the fools
Who brought the human race to fall
We'll build another generation
And not destroy the God creation

"Hay veces que no sé
Si exprimir el sol
Para sentir calor
Y dudo que al nacer, llegara a creer
Que hoy fuera a morir
Intento comprender
El por qué de esta decisión

Me intento aferrar al valor

Para saciar mi soledad
¿Dónde trafican con sueños de amor?

No tenía precio ni fin
En cambio hoy daba hasta la eternidad

Por ver mañana el sol salir
Me vengaré y todo el mal que me hagas
Yo te lo devolveré

Sé que vienen a por mí

Y un sacerdote en nombre de Dios
Pregunta ¿Quieres confesión?
Confieso que amé y creí en Dios

De los pobres, justo y moral
Confieso que en la silla
Donde he de morir

¡Mi alma renacerá!
Me vengaré y todo el mal que me hagas

No tengas miedo, no llores por mí

"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder

With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Of a storm that is gathering near
Full of power I'm spreading my wings

Through the clouds shines a ray of the sun

There is no one I can't outrun

He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him judge, his last name is dredd
So break the law, and you wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge dredd the man, he is the law
Drokk it!

With gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even death can overcome his might
Cause dredd and anderson, they won the fight
When the sov's started the apocalypse war
Mega-city was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted, and the judges fought back
Crushed the sov's with their counter-attack
Drokk it!

Respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...

I am the law!
And you won't f*ck around no more - I am the law
I judge the rich, I judge the poor - I am the law
Commit a crime I'll lock the door - I am the law
Because in mega-city... I am the law

In the cursed earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to dredd

And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his law-giver

But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that

And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out, to live my life alone
I want out, leave me be
I want out, to do things on my own
I want out, to live my life and to be free

They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be

Covered lies our remembrance

In armor and mail you were born to fight
Learned how to kill keeping the gold in sight
Who can match your fury none can give you such pain
Part man and beast time to battle again

I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink

It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

Seeing stars telling them the days
On the year
Monuments marked time
But altars meant death and fear
Worshipping gods now gone long time ago

Was it a strange decease that wiped away almost everyone?

Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in

Never let me go

Why did she leave me with the pain

Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

The day has come, the day has come,
We march to Armageddon, hungry for the war
I see the hated enemy, I see what I was taught to see

And one of us will bend the knee
We understand the law

The blood lust jerks our legs to march,
Fife and drum, fife and drum
Our eyes are fixed and fearless
Searching for the war
Our statesmen deal in blood and lies
A hundred million stifled cries, a hundred million wasted lives
Already gone before

So march or die, march or die
The stench of death is in the sky
We never fail to satisfy
We rend with tooth and claw

Sword and shield and jackboot heel
We love to kill, we love to kill
We love to taste our own blood
Squirm in our own gore

Children weep and widows wail,
Our education systems fail,
To hide our guilt we build more jails,
And we shall build still more
Our forests die, the stranglehold
That we put on the earth for gold
Will yet increase ten thousand fold
And no one knows what for

March and die, march and die
Defecate, despoil and lie
Cheat, dissemble, preach & spy
Build your house of straw

Laugh and cry, laugh and cry
Bloody sunset drowns the sky
For earth the heal then we must die
No-one deserves it more

I tell you we are doomed my friends
Our time is come, our time is come
We live within a charnel house
Rotten to the core
We glorify lust, greed & pain
We drown our hope in poison rain
We point the finger, shift the blame
Ambition makes us whores

March or croak, march or croak
All your lives a cosmic joke
Fill your days with piss and smoke

Burn and rise no more",March or Die,Metal

"The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be
Confined to this mind
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love
That's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to
Call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could
Live without pain without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again
Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep your heart in my eyes and we'll stay alive
The third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take a place
When the struggle between
Our children has ended
Now the miracle and the
Sleeper know that the third is love
Love is the dance of Eternity",Metropolis,Metal

I wish there was a rain check on tomorrow

Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray

And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate

I just want to, know why is it me?

Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early
And this hotel wasn't free

Someday you'll find someone
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own
But till then ya better

Now you're clean
And so discreet
I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin'

To this twilight zone before
We touched the rainbow
We cross the castle of the Kings and Queens

In the night where even eagles aren't free

On our way through the gates
Black moon on the horizon
Sailing on through the oceans of time
Will we ever arrive?

You got nothing to fear, 'cause your rebirth is near

Nowhere to run for my eternal bride
And when the darkness comes around
I come alive cause for your sweet blood I am bound

Come ease my pain get on your knees

Entering shadows whose number is 13

Of the curse that you bear""

"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
His pistol had been found.

They marched to the station house,
He waited for the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
He knew that he'd been wrong.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
For ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
A prisoner's life for him there'll be.

He knew that it would cost him dear,
But yet he dare not say.
Where he had been that fateful night,
A secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beats like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
He spent his final night of freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
He swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
Back in her arms he swears he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.

Over the hills and,
Over the hills and,
Over the hills and far away.

Each night within his prison cell,
He looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
She prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
Back in his arms she swears she'll be.

Over the hills and far away,
He swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
Back in her arms he swears he'll be.

And, what do you mean, I don't pay my bills?

I'm just not your kind.
What do you mean, I couldn't be president, of the United States of America?
Tell me something, it's still 'we the people', right?

"Yesterday found him today
Caught him at his last breath
These walls built to stand come-what-may
Lie shattered in the ashes
His skin against this dirty floor
Eyes fixed on the ceiling
He has stretched those chains of sin
Far beyond all feelings
Still, so still

In his head a thunderous
Cry of desperation
Tearing voices from his past
Scream for his attention
Behind those eyes a world explodes
No one there to save him
All pain that he's been passing on
Answers to his craving
Once more

I will never leave this shame

Falling beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

Stealing meaning from this child
We took away his reason
His soul put under lock and key
His heart blackened from treason
But if you take from those you fear
Everything they value
You have bred the perfect beast
Drained enough to kill you

Falling beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

Watching unseen untouched bleeding
Empty exposed dying eyes closed

Once he had forests and mountains
That were only his - listening to him
Once he would run through the summer days
Catching memories for ages to come
Now he is dressing this naked floor
With his flesh and blood, and times passes by
His trade of pain might just have lead him
To deal with consequence
For some change as time passes by

I am the waking child
(Lingering, climbing, clinging, clutching
Craving, clawing, hurting, falling down)
I, the wayward son of a mountain lake
(Of icy liquor tears, of a silent Earth)
(Of a rusty lid, of a wingless wind)
(Of an eyeless storm, of fallen gods,
who lost their way)
I set myself on fire
To breed the Perfect Element

Will I ever walk again?

Falling far beyond the point of no return
Nothing to become and nothing left to burn

(This is the end)

Nothing left to say,
The pain will go away
Now you must surely see,
That you are killing me
You are killing me
Now you are killing me
(You must never leave this shame!)
Now you are killing me
(You must never leave this shame!)
Now you are killing me
(You must never leave this shame!)

"Settle down you all
Can't you hear the footsteps
Down the hall?

Find my way back home
Now everyone I love
Has been left alone
And everyone starts dying

It's you and I
Begging for life
It's you and I

Of arguments and lies

Will my sights go dark before the end?
Will I see the landing lights again?

To travel like the wind?

Can you guarantee the sun
Won't melt away my wings
Way before my journey's done?

Never thought I was out of time

Where rain would never fall?
Or did you listen to a lie
Did you radio to base?

But you left without a trace

When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat.

On the way I cross the line forevermore.
For once in life, I do not care
Nothing matters, now I dare
On the ride I'll cross the line
Forever to be free

Visions were torn from the lies that melted out the sane
They did it for love and gave it for free
Now all the things that are left

Are there for you and me

"Katie was a kid, I guess she hid her thoughts from everyone
Went to school at eight, she was never late
Didn't know the meaning of fun
Every night Katie prayed to God above
But her daddy gave her everything but love

Her mummy read the letter, It did say:
""I'm on my way, I'm on my way""

She's having fun fun fun

It was no go, cause she rode with Joe, he was the leader of thepack

Through shadows by the wall

Everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit
He's never been seen at all

Some dictator felt progressive
And lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive
They killed him with a gun

You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire
But never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire
To throw a lance into his head

Romeo loved his Juliet
Their parents told them ""Stop""
Then it all turned out peculiar
He couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain
When you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown
By your own

Feelings you like
Disappear overnight
You sip up every grin
Free to win

It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all

You can't recall or care at all

That takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket
But she's strolling 'round in bars

Bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless
She did it with a chair

Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong

In her red satin dress
And her high heeled shoes
She took us all by surprise
And when she asked us what we wanted to do

She said it with her eyes
Just getcha rocks off
Whoah
Well when we finally took the stage

There she was but she wasn't on her own
'Cause she'd brought some friends maybe 5 or 6
Yeah, she must have been on the phone
And when they started dancing and jumping around

Well we couldn't believe our eyes
'Cause they'd got the whole damn audience rockin'
And they'd got us paralyzed
Just get ya rocks off
Thank you
Goodnight

"[The story of Round Table. It was crafted of the finest wood in Britain. Around this Round Table Arthur gathered the most valiant and noble knights in all the land. The ideals of the Round Table were: Honesty, bravery, daring, magnanimity, being of service to the other Knights of the Round Table, and loyalty. The names of some of the Knights of the Round Table were: Sir Kay, Sir Balin and Sir Balan, Sir Parcival, Sir Gaiwan, Sir Tristan, Sir Irec and, of course, Sir Lancelot. An important aim of the Knights of the Round Table was to find the Holy Grail]

Steel in our hands

To make out wrong from right
Give us the will to choose the Right
And the readiness to sacrifice

"I try to call the Earth's command,
Desperation in my voice.
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice.

The loneliness is hard to bear,
I try to calm my fear.
Just hoping, any second now,
Some contact filters through.

Desperate calls
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes
Right in front of me.

Try again, must get through.
Hear me now
For I've very little time.
Not much time, hear my call.
Please get through, I am here.

I'm lost with a trace.
I haven't a chance of getting away.

"I walk the lonely plains
Drift into the distance
Out on a rainy shore
Somewhere in time
Recall a thousand names
All of those we're missing
Out there I'm searching for
A little peace of mind

Who am I to rely on a broken dream
Just a loner in the night

Whenever we loose someone
Whenever we say goodbye
And after the fire's gone
When every flame has died
There will beat a savage heart

Another soldier falls
Dies for God and country
When there's no time for talking
Its time for the guns
Out where the wild wind blows
I'm free as a bird
If I could only transfer
Dreams into words

I'm aware; I'll be there, when the morning comes
Guided by the inner light

Whenever we loose someone
Whenever we say goodbye
And after the fire's gone
When every flame has died
There is still a savage heart

We build our world of flesh and blood

Take a look at what you have, and the things you own.
And thank God that you've grown.
Children starving and lonely, no place to go.
I really feel that there's hope.

Feelin bad I'm feelin sad, let's lend a helping hand.

Oh save, oh save, save the weak.
With a little love, that's all they need.

And we've seen its vast armies form

Please, save us

In permanent madness we live
No time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity comes from below
To take us all

We believe that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God

Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
Waiting for his future and the final call

We stand on the edge of the world
Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without you we're weak and alone

Save us, from the dogs of war

Save us, from the hate attack

I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry in shadows I can't hide

It takes me back to a past event
It's like a drug that I need every day
I need to preserve it, have to get it my way

Forever I'll have this desire
This scent - keeps me alive and fills my soul
Forever engulfed by its fire
This scent - consumes my mind and takes control

The feelings I get when memory comes back
Gives me something in my life I lack
It takes me away to the place I seek
And my being reaches its highest peak

Around your twisted human shell

Say about you 
Look at yourself and suffer
Dive into hell you unholy and rotten
Lay down among the abandoned forgotten now

We'll have a sermon and a wonderful recital
But before we go on there's something I must mention
An important message I must bring to your attention
I was in meditation and prayer last night
I was awakened by a shining bright light
Overhead a glorious spirit, he gave me a message and you all need to hear it
""Send me your money,"" that's what he said
He said to ""Send me your money""
Now if you can only send a dollar or two
There ain't a hell of a lot I can promise to you
But if you wants to see heaven's door
Make out a check for five hundreds or more
""Send me your money"", do you hear what I said?

Now give me some bass, um yea that's how he like it
Now let's have some silence, for all you sinners
Now give me more bass, yea that was funky
Now take them on home Brother Clark, send me your money
Here comes another con hiding behind a collar
His only God is the almighty dollar
He ain't no prophet, he ain't no healer
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer
Send me your money
Send it, you got to send it
Send me your money
You hear what I'm saying?
You got to send it, send it
Send me your money

Now how much you give is your own choice
But to me it is the difference between a Porsche and a Rolls Royce
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket
'Cause it makes me feel so good to watch my profits rocket

Send me your money
Now dig in deep, dig real deep into your pocket
I want you to make it hurt!

We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them

Chew me up like a meat grinder
You're cold-blooded like a sidewinder
I don't need another reminder

Can't understand normal thinking
Drive a sober man to drinking
In fact you drive me straight to Hell

We are miserable
You are driving me insane

This could be yours sign that things are going wrong

"The spell has been broken 
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels
Of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, 
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods, and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign",Sign of the Hammer,Metal

Lost in the sea, a man is searching for land.
But an angel is guiding him,
a superior force is showing him the way through his quest.

[1st Verse:]
Sun be my guide
Can you see where is the right side ?
In my quest
Which feels so hard
I heard a voice
Coming from the sky

[Bridge:]
Passing through the storm
And find your land
You have to be proud
Follow your way

It comes the wind
And the rain on my way
But the sun has never shown me its light
This kind of fear gives me force in my head
The sign of the winner is in my eyes

[2nd Verse:]
Sea, magic sea
Victory resounds to my mind
Future is not so far
The angel's voice calls me one more time

Passing through the storm
And find your land
You have to be proud
Follow your way

Staining the earth such a beautiful red

I am God, I am fate, I am all the sins you make, yeah - hate.
I am black, I am white, I am the blood upon the knife, yeah - hate.

Since time began I made a vow to drag you underground;
To steal your soul of purity and watch you waste away.

I am pure, I am right, I'm the God that makes you fight, yeah - hate.
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final breath, yeah - hate.

And face the fear that's here
Until the Silence Screams
it leaves you with no choice to carry on.

When all is said and done

"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

Looked down and waved his hands

As he flew into the sun
Howled about redemption
With a bible and a gun
The preacher beat his chest
And cried: ""Set my people free""
The killer said: ""I drag you
To the gates of hell with me

And now I'll tell You 
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends

Welcome to the wasteland
In a world which is turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while
It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins

The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun

So I'm not afraid
To walk down to the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty god forsaken path

And behind

I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy

Welcome to the new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins

The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all

What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all

And now I'll tell You 
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends

"All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all ok
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down

Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest

Turn in the god seeds of creation

We'll celebrate, build a life of pardon
Centuries will pass, pations will win

A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this is my house
I am the master of the tides, I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres across the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore, my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this was my house
I was the keeper of the books, I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear, I cast a shadow through the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free

Chain up the demons set free

Cause I'm here

To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
Wouldn't it?
There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory Perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around

And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Make their lives be a mystery no more

But the haters hate perfection

Friends never stick around too long 
they never feel like they belong 
next to me they feel like a fool

Being this blessed is a lonely way to be

Some decide to die

"On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I make no sound

Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

Being at the wrong place
And the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Ever moving onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never
Be the same

My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay

(I want to go to heaven)
Roll Jordan, roll Jordan

He comes, he comes
Judge so severe
Seven trumpets speak
Oh, they speak him near
Hallelujah, we'll praise the lord
Hallelujah
Hallelujah,

He comes, he comes
Judge so severe
Seven trumpets speak
Oh, they speak him near

Hallelujah, we'll praise the lord
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, we'll praise the lord
Hallelujah

Oh mother, you ought a be there
I'm gonna go to heaven when I die
(I want to go to heaven)
Roll Jordan, roll Jordan
Oh father, you ought a be there
I'm gonna go to heaven when I die
(I want to go to heaven)
Roll Jordan, roll Jordan
Oh sister, you ought a be there
I'm gonna go to heaven when I die
(I want to go to heaven)
Roll Jordan, roll Jordan
Oh brother, my sweet brother
I'm gonna go to heaven when I die
