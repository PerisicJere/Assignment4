Lyric,Song Title,Genre
"It's the kind of night that's so cold, when you spit
It freezes before it hits the ground
And when a bum asks for a quarter, you give a dollar
If he's out tonight, he must be truly down
And I'm searching all the windows for a last minute present
To prove to you what I said was real
For something small and frail and plastic baby
Cause' cheap is how I feel

Half a moon in the sky tonight, bright enough
To come up with an answer
To the question, why is it that every time I see you
My love grows a little stronger
But your memory leaves my stomach churning
Feeling like a lie about to be revealed
But I'll horde all this to myself
Cause' cheap is how I feel

It's not the smell in here that gets to me, it's the lights
How I hate the shadows that they cast
And the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing
I'll always drag with me from my past
I think I'll find a pair of eyes tonight, to fall into
And maybe strike a deal
Your body for my soul, fair swap
Cause' cheap is how I feel",'cause Cheap Is How I Feel,Rock
"I stand alone
Without a care
Open the door
But no-one's there
The lonely night
My only friend
Love's wrongs are right
I can't defend

La Passione
La Passione
La Passione

And now I know
What I've become
It haunts me so
But I'll go on and on
I know the pain inside
Is the price you pay to ride
Into the brightest flame
Never the same again

You dare to dream
Take the chance and go

Now the passion haunts you so

"When the color of the night

Get life day to day

"Hold up! Carefully holding you tighter
Carefully holding you close
Can you help me open my eyes to see what is pure
And what is right? I've been trapped in this fantasy all my life
Do I have to search for words, can I just smile?
What we have isn't far from good, nor good from far
I've made these mistakes (in the past) but our time is now
So in love, I'm falling deeper and deeper, I'll wait for you
What I have is all I have to give and I want to give you it all
Emancipation of myself is only the beginning, I'm a compass
Give me direction to go in.

You just bring me down

"Seasons change and summer's gone
Another year of love I've known
Fades like a dream
Rearrange, boy, make yourself strong
You're not the first or last who's lost everything

Hang them in some closet
Until you need them again

Oh, we'll search for one another

Stabbing sad refrain of

"From over the air comes a voice without care
Says we're doin' all right
But day out and day in from what he's been sayin'
We're in for a fight
I glance at myself and the world rushin' by
I can see for myself and the fear comes alive
Shades of termination--we're dyin' to survive

1984

Machine is the mind--it will rule by design
So you're never alone
We store information without confirmation
Accept the unknown
I think to myself of the times we have tried
To be true to ourselves and to live with the lie
Avoid the contradictions--just keep yourself alive

1984

I can't help it...I can't help it...I can't help it...
Life is your decision--we choose to do or die
Can you live with the reality of 1985

Polite conversation ain't no consolation
For blanks in your eyes
Amidst the confusion there lives the illusion
That love will survive
But I got a chance with myself if I try
To be sure of myself and myself choose to try
Fight for stimulation and love to stay alive

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says, I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very, very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes, I saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard, to let them use the pool all day for free

I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV

"Most people don't see how much work is really involved 
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta 
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm saying
No matter what you just been through

So you want to be a rap superstar
And live large a big house 
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world 
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror dreaming about blowing up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be coming with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears 
And losing some of your peers
And losing some of your self 
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep

Sign a deal emcees want to make a mill
But never will 
Till he crosses over still
Feeling no hate 
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You want to be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

So you want to be a rap superstar 
And live large

Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large

Coming up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another be	-Real
So you need to just keep 
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And motherfucking get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you 
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

My own son don't know me
Sitting up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
'cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the palladium
Who just want to cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar 
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started getting ignored
I warned him
Assured him

Be a star band, never act friendly. 
You want to have big fame 
Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains 
First they get played like all damn day 
Long as you sell everything will be ok 
Then you get dissed by the media and fans 
Things never stay the same way they began 
I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest 
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet 
Think everything's fine in the big time 
See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine

That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older, now that angels want to wear my red shoes

How come everybody wants to be your friend?

Because she's feeling so abused (oh, that's too bad)
She gets tired of the lust (oh, I'm so sad)

Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

Oh, oh I said, ""I'm so happy I could die""

Walk from me everything systematically

Of success and focus, tunneling to the light glowing deep inside of

Holding on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear it’s all down hill from here

My love in your hand cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone, crumble in the light

Most of what you see my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of want to show
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear
It’s all down hill from here",...Like Clockwork,Rock
"That Charlie Sedarka was a-playing the piano
Like he was pawing a dirty book
He bit a hole in his big bottom lip and gave his
Very best little boy look
It was a song with a topical verse which I'm
Afraid he then proceeded to sing
Something about the moody doomed love of
The Fish-Finger King

You're nobody in this town
You're nobody in this crowd
You're nobody till everybody in this town
Thinks you're poison,
Got your number knows it must be avoided
You're nobody till everybody in this town
Thinks you're a bastard

Mr. Getgood moved up to Self-Made Man Row
Although he swears that he's the salt of the earth
He's so proud of the ""kick-me-hard"" sign that
They hung on his back at birth
He said ""I appreciate beauty, if I have one, then
It's my fault""
""Beauty is on my pillow, beauty is there in
My vault""

[Chorus]

The girl with the eternity rock went down on
Her bookie to buy some stock
Now all her signs in the shopping arcades say
""The corporation thief is The New Jesse James""
Her clothes and her attention were scant, her
Eyes were everywhere,
Her eyes were like absinthe
The little green figures that dance on his screen
Say everything you want to hear and nothing
They mean
They made love while she was changing her dress
She wiped him off she wiped him out and then
She made him confess
A little amused by the belief in her power
You must remember this it was the fetish of
The hour

I see a shadow

Sailing across the sea

Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
One thousand hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
One thousand hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop once we start

Taking state by state by country over night
Living in a shelter and every fight
Seeing millions of people Rage

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses, leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle, watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though, there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

I'll be back for all y'all...",12,Rock
"Hey, Merry Christmas, Adam! Merry Christmas, Fred!
Merry Christmas to everyone
Yeah man
You having a good year?
Yeah, it just feels good to be next to you here on the holidays
Hearing you say merry Christmas
It just warms my heart, man
It's like soul food, like fired okra
Dude, I'm having a great holiday this year, it's awesome
Yeah man, so you wanna sing for these people or what?
Yeah, here we go, okay

On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
I don't even know what a partridge is, to be honest
A partridge is a bird
I think it's a bird that doesn't fly
Like Danny Bonaduce?
Um, no, it's
He's ripped, ripped I'm telling you
I heard he's a little, you know, fallen on the deep end, maybe
Oh, yeah, well
He's gonna kick my ass now
No, it's against that napoleon complex, he's short

So, on the, on the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
Turtle doves?
They're nice, do they have shells?
Uh, I don't know

But, on the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
From now on can you sing
""And a Danny Bonaduce""?

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce
That's good! Yeah, yeah, it works, the syllables

Yeah, so I started to wonder
If my true love, my old lady
Was going to get me anything
Other than a bunch of birds
Yeah, they're all, like, pooping everywhere and stuff, it's gross
They're hard to clean up after
So far she got me four calling birds,
French hens, turtle doves
The French hens, which are the French hens
They're eating all your cheese
Drinking up all your wine
Like all hours of the day
I love France
So, I was wondering when
She was going to get me something good

And on the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Nice!
Yeah, I was finally happy
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a par-Danny Bonaduce

So, like, with the five golden rings
That's kinda nice
Yeah, but on the sixth day, she started getting-
Like Lil Wayne
Or what's another rapper
That has like a bunch of silly jewelry?
Um, I don't know any, man

But, on the sixth day
It kinda went downhill
And the seventh cause she got me
Six geese a-laying
Geese a-laying?
Like laying down?
No, like, geese that are laying
Like, oh, like
That's gross, yeah, I don't know about that
And then on the seventh day-
I often wonder how geese would go about doing that
If you're picking up what I'm putting down
I-I don't want to talk about it, man, okay

On the seventh day?
Seventh day
Seven swans swimming
More birds!
Swimming?
I hate it

On the eight day it got really weird
Cause on the eight day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids a-milking
What?! Yeah!
What, are they milking the geese cause they're laying?
I think they're like lactating or something
I don't get that, yeah
I'm not into it

But, on the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine ladies dancing
Nice! Okay, cool
Oh, well that explains the maids a-milking
No, these were like exotic dancers
Like you can see on the internet
Yeah, it was nice
There was like one of those poles and all that stuff
Yeah, but this is your old lady
That's getting you all these things, that's kinda weird
I know, but she's looking out for me, you know
Tenth day, tenth day, okay

On the tenth day it got crazy again
Cause she gave me ten lords a -leaping
Like the dark lords?
I don't know
That's so weird, and then the eleventh day
Pipers piping
Pipers piping?
These are, by far, the strangest gifts I have ever received
I don't understand-
Wait, like, laying pipe?
No, that's the geese that are laying pipe
Oh, well maybe they're laying it with the pipers
Which would be weird all together

But, on the twelfth day of Christmas
This is the last day
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Everybody could use a good drummer
Yeah, I could use twelve drummers, yeah
The Grateful Dead had two drummers
Dude, Slipknot has like ten, yeah
Did you get to, like, choose which drummers
Or are they just studio guys?
I think they were pretty bad ass
Oh, cool
I mean, not that Mark's not
I mean, Mark's kicking some ass, yeah
You know
Was he one of the twelve?
Um, I don't know, but

So, let's go down the list
And finish this godforsaken song off
Oh, okay and wish everyone a very merry Christmas

Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Let's give it up for the ladies dancing
Go ladies! Okay
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce

Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me

Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

Fueled with anger, music was my wrath

Climb on your your dream, a dream of our own making

To whatever time would bring.

Moving you to greater things (in a lesser way) 
You had to prove. 
The clock struck summertime. You were going round in circles now. 
Wishing you were seventeen. At twenty-one, it was a long time gone. 
And now here you are. You're locked in your own excuse. 
The circle's getting smaller every day. 
You're busy planning the next fifty years. 
So stay the way you are and keep your head down to the same old ground. 
Just paint your picture boy until you find 
A closed circle's better than an open line.

To fight for a land fit for heroes,
God on my side, and a gun in my hand,
Chasing my days down to zero,
And I marched and I fought and I bled and I died,
And I never did get any older,
But I knew at the time that a year in the line,
Was a long enough life for a soldier,

We all volunteered, and we wrote down our names,
And we added two years to our ages,
Eager for life and ahead of the game,
Ready for history's pages,
And we brawled and we fought and we whored 'til we stood,
Ten thousand shoulder to shoulder,
A thirst for the Hun, we were food for the gun,
And that's what you are when you're soldiers,

I heard my friend cry, and he sank to his knees,
Coughing blood as he screamed for his mother,
And I fell by his side, and that's how we died,
Clinging like kids to each other,
And I lay in the mud and the guts and the blood,
And I wept as his body grew colder,
And I called for my mother and she never came,
Though it wasn't my fault and I wasn't to blame,
The day not half over and ten thousand slain,
And now there's nobody remembers our names
And that's how it is for a soldier",1916,Rock

"How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960 
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun, just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun, just watch me shine 
Today 
I've played this part so many times 
Since the end of '59 
But like the sun, just watch me shine

And none of us know quite what to say,
But the feeling moved
Among us in silence anyway.
Slowly we had made
Quite a change
Somewhere we had crossed a big line.
Down upon our knees,
We had tasted holy wine,
And no one could sway us
In a life time.

Purer than the sky,
Behind the rain.
Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.
Love had lit a fire;
We were the flame.
Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

Not a word.
And no one had to say we were changed.
Nothing else we lived through
Would ever be same the same,
Knowing the truth
That we had gained.

Purer than the sky,
Behind the rain.
Falling down all around us,
Calling out from a boundless love.
Love had lit a fire;
We were the flame.
Burning into the darkness,
Shining out from inside us.

Stay with me.
Make it ever new,
So time will not undo,
As the years go by,
How I need to see
That's still me.

Talking to the maker

Call the undertaker

Meet me in 2001

Saw the ones who twist her 
A social suicide 
If looks could kill 
Each and every cheap thrill 
Could be a homicide 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

Or notes that fall gently like rain

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down
Home, to change

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh, no

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

Aquel rincón que te dejé,
Donde guardo los momentos que no olvidé

Olvidamos lo demás,
El cielo se volvió rojo al sol
Vimos bostezar,
Se ha perdido entre la gente,

Un ayer

Parlava un'altra lingua, pero' sapeva amare

L'ora piu' dolce prima di essere ammazzato

Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno piu' corto
E benche' non sapesse il nome e neppure il paese
Mi aspetto' come un dono d'amore fin dal primo mese

Compiva 16 anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna, le canto' a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva, sapeva di mare
Giocava a fare la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro signore
Della sua breve vita e' il ricordo piu' grosso
E' tutto in questo nome che io mi porto addosso

E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo gesu' bambino

In Cadillac limousines

Under tube trains and commuter accidents
In council care and county courts
At Easter fairs and sea-side resorts
In drawing rooms and city morgues
In award winning photographs
Of life rafts on the China seas
In transit camps, under arc lamps
On unloading ramps
In faces blurred by rubber stamps

Myself in every stranger's eyes

And now, from where I stand
Upon this hill
I plundered from the pool
I look around
I search the skies
I shade my eyes
So nearly blind
And I see signs of half remembered days
I hear bells that chime in strange familiar ways
I recognise...

And I found it was loving

Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in

Below me was a homeless man
I'm singin' songs I knew complete
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand
It's fifty years, stood where he stands

Now walkin' home on those streets
The river winds move my feet
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams
They stood by me, just like moonbeams

Look out the window, down upon that street
And gone like a midnight was that man
But I see his six strings laid against that wall
And all his things, they all look so small

I got my fingers crossed on a shooting star
Just like me just moved on",6th Avenue Heartache,Rock

Watch the red line creeping upwards
Watch the sanity line weaken

Bubble under these crazed eruptions
It wriggles and writhes and bites within
Just below the sweating skin

Now I watch the red line, reach that number again

I could still remember that stifling antiseptic smell
Of the hospital corridor
As you clutched my hand and hurried down the hall
I think you knew as you looked up at me
That we would never see each other again
And I felt so all alone as they wheeled you out the doors and told me to
Wait
And then there was a cry
And the doctor came out and showed me our baby girl
You never saw her sweetheart
But she must of known you somewhere
Because she looks, and acts, and talks the way I remember you

Like a martyr that don't want sympathy
I locked away my feelings and threw away the key

When your loving washed right over me like the tide

Down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt My mind begin to
Fight a battle for control

With the tea pot broken I kind of
Realized
That ""THEIR"" power was less here,
Here on the outside

I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
To the cellar

Things were moving down there,
""THEY"" were searching for something
And ""THEY"" really found it,
The big axe was flying

Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then I passed out

The smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw was
Actually... Oh No!

Dress, poor little girl

Change

"Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

Nobody understands what it takes to be the man
Having every single person say you can't when you can
To give up everything you've ever known for a dream
And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems
You sacrifice, you bleed, you sweat, and you cry
Doing everything you can not to lay down and die
When you fall and you call out, there's no one to help
So you've got no other option but to pick up yourself
At the end of the battle you're the only one standing
Everyone watching, the stage you're commanding
The pages of history will speak of today
And when they talk about the champion
This is what they'll say

Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

People will break you right down to nothing if you let 'em
They'll say, ""There's a million others like you, what makes you better?""
But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown
They're the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home
Stay Down: Is what they scream in your ear
The only weapon that they have to use is fear
So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits,
But your back on your feet for more, you don't quit
You'll never back down, never stop, never pause
Never give up, never sacrifice the cause
This is your life, you gonna let somebody take it?
Look in the mirror That's all you need to make it
Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

The smoke has all cleared, and you own the throne
You're king of the castle, and everybody knows
They bow in your presence, and fear your might

"It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy Name and Brigid were playing under my stair case
on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning

I woke up
because Amos and Archie had started barking
That made me very angry
because I wasn't feeling well and I told them
I was very cross the real me
that they just better remember
what happened to Sam the bad cat
that was left at home and got sick and went pussy heaven

It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
and so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
but the exposure thing wasn't right
and I was going to call Fred or Gerry
to find out how to get set it
I was too late
and then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
and anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
but the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
and I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
from down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
and I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
lately in the neighborhood
and someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
there were Brigid and Billy playing

And under the stair case
was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
but they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
but I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
it's my magazine, isn't it?

So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
and I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called Billy
but either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
which was so strange
because
even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than Ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
and he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it

And then I saw John Cale
he's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
but he's been really mean since he went to AA
I mean what does it mean
when you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not
let's face it
going to get any ideas up at the office

And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
and I had been thinking about them
when I was on St. Marks Place
going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
but the thought I was old
and then I saw the old DOM
the old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that Velvet's first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
and I always see it repackaged
and I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call Henry
but it was good seeing John
I did a cover for him
but I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
but you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that

I tried calling again to Billy and John
they wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in

And then I saw Lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the MTV show
and he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate Lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him

I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
from those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
and four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
and I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
the doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
'couse they ran out or veins
but then
all this thinking was making me an old grouch
and you can't do anything anyway so
if they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
and another

So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,

Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.

Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.

Tocando o pé no chão

A fuego lento tú o nada
Vamos fraguando esta locura
Con la fuerza de los vientos y el calor de la ternura

Sigue el camino del cortejo
A fuego lento, a fuego viejo
Sigue avivando nuestra llama
Con todo lo que te quiero y lo mucho que me amas

A fuego lento me haces agua
Contigo tengo el alma enamorada
Me llenas, me vacías, me desarmas
Ah-ah-ya-ay, amor, cuando me amas
A fuego lento, revoltosas
Caricias que parecen mariposas
Se cuelan por debajo de la ropa
Y van dejando el sentimiento
Amor forjado a fuego lento

A fuego lento, mi cintura
A fuego lento, y con usura
Vamos tramando este alboroto
Con la danza de los mares y el sabor del poco a poco

Sigo el camino del cortejo
A fuego lento, a fuego añejo
Sigo avivando en nuestra llama
Tantos días como sueños, tantos sueños que no acaban

Don't you fight your own wars?

I'll face it like a fighter then boast of how I've grown

I know 'cause I listen when the experts say

My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now, I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days is hard to find

I know it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will all be worth it in the end

I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
A white ladder all covered with water

I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's a hard road till I die

Agony within masturbations of the devil
The chatter of white noise is calling
Enter the loathing of tortured souls
With fear came thunder
Where the soil is red as blood
A voice of fire screams from the abyss
This book of the witch's hammer to provoke this raven deluge
Broken steps of the ladder in reversal of attainment
As locusts swarm from madness
Necromantic recollection of existence
Forty legions are cleansed in the imprecation of ancient tongues
Transmissions from the empire of evil spirits
Entity of dark faith to succumb to the murders of unlikely prayer
Great harbinger seduced from foreseen malediction
Outside perception of unleashed evil
Curious in the restraints of the blackness in hope
Raise the prodigy to ensnare with hateful thought
Future of slaved angels encased in ribcage tombs
Crawling in devout worship of starless contempt
Great one engulfed in forever dream
Releasing all the sorrows of mankind
Merciless in sleep of this ashen existence from soundness of death
Proclaim the attraction of this sinister treason
Conformed by the five Satans outside these chambers of reason
Defile the consciousness beneath this frame of pristine balance
Troubled ceremony in hopes to speak through the underworld
Teachings of horror induced in the overbearing of an ideal
Bloodless execution in the attributes of divinity

"Sé que la próxima vez que te vea
no me aguanto why me como la noche en tu piel
si me dejas.

Si te parece yo pago la cena
why brindamos para celebrarlo con copas de amor
a la luz de tus piernas.

¿Qué quieres que diga 
si ya no me entero?
Que doy lo que sea por mojarme en ti.

Te vendo mi calma, 
total pa qué la quiero,
si sólo se dedica a interrumpir.
Te vendo mi calma,
no la echaré de menos.
No tanto como a ti.

¿Ves? Es tan fácil perder la cabeza.
Me conformo con poco que des si te puedo tener

"Todo fue un cuento de mil una noches 
Solo un poema de amor y ternura 
Nos envidiaba hasta el mar que jugaba 
A esconderse allá en las dunas

Tanto vagar por las noches de luna 
Era un andar por arenas doradas 
Eran dos almas de amor entregadas 
Que de quererse jamás 
Se cansaban

Tuvo en la arena su lecho de espuma 
Que hizo por techo un cielo estrellado 
Y aun que fue mía una noche en verano 
Ya rendida me engañaba 

Todo fue engaño y falsas promesas 
Solo mentiras que lindas mentiras 
Era su cuerpo cual fruta de mayo 
Que en otros brazos también maduraba 

Donde estás ahora
Mujer que tanto amé 
Tu risa mañanera
Sigue despertándome 

Si al volver dijeras
Olvido no logré 
Mi razón diría 
Mientes, mientes 
Mientes 

Eres mujer",A la Mujer Que Tanto Ame,Rock
"If heartaches brought fame
In loves crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time

If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time

But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain

Everyone would know my name

"Sitting here in my cell writing a letter
Thanking all the people who made my living conditions better

And thanks to the justice system
I'm making a million
My lawyer got me a book deal
Now I'm making a killing just from making a killing

I got an agent for the publicity
An accountant to count my royalties
The talk shows want me, sorry I can't go
I'm stuck here on death row

You call me Hannibal Lechter, if I was smarter
If I was Charlie Manson you'd make me a martyr wouldn't ya
You'd call me a handsome man if I was Bundy
But if I looked like John Wayne Gasey you'd just say I'm funny, not ha ha funny

Tried to act my career just flopped
Killed my neighbor, got on Cops
Problem is, I only made one show now
I'm stuck here on death row

The poor victim's families never make a dime
Networks say I'm not prime time
All my cell mates on my cell block
Say I'm the hottest topic at the coffee shops

Waitress cries, ""God how they should free me""
Send me her love letters, says someday she'd really love to meet me
Tells her customers people should forgive me for the things I do
I wonder if I kill her would her family forgive me too?

The taxpayer's dollars that you spend on me
Thanks for the good meal, dry bed, and these warm clothes

What choices to make and what futures you'd see

How hard it is now

I know I could never go back there again
But if there was one thing I wish I could say

What a weird idea
What would I tell you, and what would you hear?

Do I have to say to you
That we don't really change
After all I've been through how I'm still just the same

And I know
How hard it is now
But there'll come a day when you turn it around
Facin' your demons on the underground

It pales so soon, waned with the moon

Make the going really tough
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

And a beautiful house
And me, well you wanted me

When it suited your needs
And now, now I have nothing
Just a handful of faded photographs
Nothing but a cold empty heart

But I'm not easily forgotten
I'll appear when you least expect
To make you pay
You asked for it that way

She'll come to get you with a knife
Write poison letters to your wife
Totally destroy your life

Drag your name through the dirt
Make sure that it really hurts
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

An error on your part can be a costly one for you
But looking back how often have you thought. well I'll be blowed
If it wasn't for that error. I'd be on a different road

Frightened and alone

The cities charred and ruined
The herds of homeless people
Filling all the roads

Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Bullets paint the blue distance
The mirror's stained from every gun
Still, I say that it glistens
In the heart of everyone

And there are golden whispers
Within the afternoon
They've held the brothers, sisters
Felt the mothers' wounds
The broken-hearted people
Burying their own

Some may pray to their mirrors
Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Light the candle, and we're shown

Where the water lilies grow
And on the jukebox johnny sang

And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While ray and philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

In blindness and decay

Talking about a past
And future secret
Most called him once

And future king
Far back in the past
I saw his ending
Long before it started

I knew his name

Out of the stone
It's how that ancient tale began

I hear it in the cold winds

I had seen it in my dreams

I feel cold
When I cry out for the bark
Take him back to Avalon

Dwell on for a new age
So long sleep well my friend
Take him back to Avalon
I will wait and guard

ladies and gentlemen
good evening
ok so
tonight i'm
going to sing
pizzicato five's 
new number

i feel like
today everything
will be alright
so much
it frightens me

if i call 
you today
will you please
say this
one word
'love'

this new
morning's
memorandum number one:
everybody is in the quest
of a perfect world

i'm humming 
a song i just learned 
in this new morning

love is always like this
it begins suddenly
for no apparent reason

especially in the morning
a clear early morning
on a day when
everything looks
shining bright
on a day when you whispered
one word: 'love'

this new morning's
memorandum number two:
the perfect world
will simmer with love

in the new morning
i'm welling up within
welling up with tears

the follow up for
this morning's memorandum:
there is a perfect world
somewhere i'm sure

in the new morning
fresh juice

everything is going
too well today
it's as if the world
was going to change today

when everything
goes
wrong
please just say this
one word: 'love'
and hug me

of this morning's memorandum:
one day
there will be a perfect world

"I leave as I enter, another boy caught in-between
Now all I can muster are whispers to your screams
Don't you remember how you eased my disgrace?
Don't you remember the love you saw in my face?

Perfected in silence
A physical presence

I sought affection, but now I realize
A cold rejection, the movement in your eyes
But I can remember when you shook against me
I can remember when I saw what love could be

Perfected in silence
A physical presence

Ain't what she did, it's the way that she did it
When I couldn't give, only she could forgive it
Ain't what she did, it's the way that she did it
As long as I live, it's for me to relive it
Silence

Part of the answer is that there's really no escape
Part of the answer is that life can have such perfect shape
Don't you remember all the nights you shared in my disgrace?
Don't you remember that the love that filled this empty space 
Was

Perfected in silence?

"Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You've seen it all,you've seen it all
Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of them dream, most of them dream

Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothing to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late
I've done a bit of smuggling, I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last

And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishing, got to go fishing, down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends

I go for younger women, lived with several a while
Though I ran them away, they'd come back one day
Still could manage to smile
Just takes a while, just takes a while

"It started off a routine day 
I got through the morning in the usual way 
I caught the bus on time 
Good morning, Mr. Driver, drive 
As I sat inside my overcoat I clutched my cane 
And pressed my nose against the foggy window pane 
Ho hum 
The life I lead would even make a dead man yawn 
Midday comes 
I break for lunch 
With my sandwich and a beer I go on a hunch 
To the park where I hope to find 
A little bit of peace of mind 

As I sat there on a bench amidst the rodent race 
I felt a strange sensation that without a trace appeared 
But then as quickly disappeared again 

So tell me what's the bloody point of playing the game 
With so much to lose yet so little to gain 
You sell your life away 
Can't you see you're just a cog working like a dog 
You trade your future for a dead-end job 
That's full of routine days

I race the clock to the end of my day 
The paycheck in my pocket makes me feel okay 
But was it worth the grind

See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace

I can only hold your hand. Live.

disassociate
yourself. Tools of your trade, survival. It's the only
safe
place left anymore. But can you tell me, are
you here now? Is my touch
touching you, or that tool
of yours? I saved all the debt for you, you're
still
in debt. You're broken wings I have taken on to mend
and right now I'd
do the same onto you if it would
change a thing. If I could cripple your mind

"When you reach number ten and think the struggle ends
But in the end it's only a trend
You have to unbend 'cause it's only a trend
Don't lose all your friends don't make heroes end

When you reach number eight it ain't no pearly gate
'Cause it won't satiate your growing appetite
You can ply your trade and push your crusade
Emancipate or indoctrinate, but the traps are all laid for any honest crusade

Your old values will fade as you struggle to make the grade
As you struggle to make the grade
You struggle to make the grade, you needn't bother

When you hear number four you're almost through the door
But there's a whole lot more you just can't ignore
The telephone's sure, you know the score
But don't let this uproar dissipate your encore

It's written in the news how you paid your dues
But you've no excuse for the people you abuse

When you reach number one you can beat your drum
Sack your roadies in Birmingham
When your record is platinum, you can stick it to the bath
To the wall like you've always planned

It's written in the news how you paid your dues
There's no excuse for the people you abuse

When you reach number ten

For the people you abuse
You got no excuse

Pat my back

The blinkered arcade, 
In search of another to share in his life.

And questioned his story again.

What about the poor bearing poverty's marks
What about the sick whose lives are torn apart
What about those whose rights aren't respected

Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage

Crowned in debt as the new face of slavery
Died by design with a senseless hope 
And a never ending rope
What about the leaders abusing authority
Corrupt moral compass guarded bureaucracy

Get distracted while they take your civil liberty
Thoughts and prayers again, is that what it'll take?
Which industries profit while lives are at stake

Starring at the screen to tell us what they find
Manifesto, dollar, worship get on your knees
So they can sell us a cure for the American disease

And it was easy then to say what love could do
It's so easy when your world is new

It's been so hard sometimes to find my way
I let my pleasure lead my little world astray
And if I'm truthful I'll say that I was blind
To everything about this life but what I had in mind

And it was easy then to say where love could go
It's so easy when there's so much you don't know

About my imagination, it got me through somehow
Without my imagination, I wouldn't be here now

And it was easy then when love was guaranteed
It's so easy when love is all you need

Into my imagination
According to my computations
We're overdue for a transformation
Or is it my imagination?

I keep my eyes open and try to see
This life in terms of possibility
With so much changing, and changing for the worse
You got to keep your head up, Baby
From the cradle to the hearse

And it was easy then to say where love could go
It's so easy when love is all you know

I'm bringing my imagination
Taking charge of my elevation
No fear, no trepidation
Register my affirmation
No doubt, no hesitation
People get ready for the embarkation

Threatening winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick, barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast

Hanging small in a pale blue sky,
Never knowing which way's up

I have to wonder, will I be around
As my anger shouts, at my own self doubt,
So a sadness creeps, into my dreams

I get scared of giving and I must find the faith to beat it

I must be me that's rushing by,
Time just lingers on the wind.

I looked across this world, there was no one to be seen
This empty feeling turned and quietly walked away
I saw no warmth in life, no love was in my eyes

As i hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!

I need the strength to go and get what i want
I lost a lifetime thinking of it
And lost an era daydreaming like i do

But look around this world, there's millions to be seen
Come see the tyrants panic see their crumbling empires fall
Then tell 'em we don't fight for fools -

You said you'd always hold me
But you run away with me Acapulco gold

 Like we both grew up with nothin' 
 And I can't believe my own memory

 And I don't even know the wrong I've done 
 And I don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love

 I was burnt, stood up in Mayfair 
 I caught a train, black car through the rain 
 From the trust that hung betrayed there 

 And I don't even know the wrong I've done 
 And I don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love 

 Well, the attorney grins, the witness is drug in 
 With his face half hid in shadow 
 Sworn to God and State the truth arrives too late 
 And defense goes out the window 

 And we don't even know the wrong we've done 
 And we don't even care anymore 
 All I know is I believe that you and me 
 Forever will stand accused of love 
 Will stand accused of love 
 Will stand accused of love",Accused of Love,Rock
"Could this be true
Could this be me
The one who kept himself so high and free
Caught up in the highest game of all
And all my defences tumble and fall
Only the ace of hearts can save now

I wake in early hours and call your name
It's your face I see pressed up against my window pane
And suddenly I realize
As the tears start to fall like rain from the sky
Only the ace of hearts can save me now
Said only the ace of hearts can save me now

Ace of hearts tell me what's this game we're playing
Ace of hearts it's all down to you
I'm lost, lost like a child in a strange dream
Open your doors and pull me
Pull me trough

And I'm flying like the wind in the dead of night
Flying so high searching for those landing lights
I've never been this high before
But darling all I need is your love more and more
And only the ace of hearts can save me now",Ace of Hearts,Rock
"There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

This life is not one that I own, Do I dramatise?
These days I think I'll stay at home, By the fireside
Just leave the outdoors to get on, While I theorise

There is nothing here to celebrate
I should be kickin' out my heels parade, Ah

If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

I've picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around

At least three times in a single week, I am run aground
There is no warning I can seek, I am always found
There is no rhyme or reason to this, A fault appears
With the gaping hollow under my feet, I disappear

There is nothing here to stop me
I just fall until it's got me, Ah
If it fits then I'll wear it
If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

Forgive a little low, I won't let it last
With every little day that passes

Destilei óleo de linhaça
E da sua cama arranquei pedaços
Que talhei em estiletes de tamanhos diferentes

E fiz então, pincéis com seus cabelos
Fiz carvão do batom que roubei de você
E com ele marquei dois pontos de fuga
E rabisquei meu horizonte

Eu juro que não foi por mal, eu não queria machucar você
Prometo que isso não vai acontecer mais uma vez

I dreamed she came, when I was down and
I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
There's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here
Well I know

You will find your way across the river
Row down slow

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Prey to the predator, love as we're falling down.

Welcome to fray and feast, bliss in all sorrows found.
Rhythm and random moves and waves of revelations.

As pain and joy and sorrow mingle.
Patterns we're finding

Delight and suffering, these roles that we have found.
Nourished by food we eat, hungered by waste excrete.

Font que t'oses plus mettre sur pause

Allez goinfre-toi, vas-y mange, sur le dos des autres
Et fais des exploits toujours dans la faute

Why I'm here, why I'm living

"Have you ever thought about your soul can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear, yes I think it's too late",After Forever,Rock

And then the sound of a breaking window and the scream of a tire
And then the sound of a distant gun and the cry of a hungry child
The night is hot
But nothing's gonna stop
This gang going wild

He rode his brother's Harley across the TV while I was laughing at Dom deLuise.
Now I'm cycling all my video tapes, I'm crying and I'm joking
I've gotta stop drinking
I've gotta stop thinking
I've gotta stop smoking

Blackening the promises the tears and the rain
The fire will burn

And you'll find me out here on the line.
Searching ceaselessly to simply
Find a place I can call mine.
Every corner of this country
Criss-crossed out with coloured lines.
The city lies before me,
Another city sprawling out behind.
Since the Scramble ended,
Since the West was won with wagon trails,
It seems the Mazzini's paradisical
Panopticon prevailed.
My walkabouts no longet take me
Beyond a choice of different gaols.
Why should I have to choose a state
When every one of them has failed?
I am a frontiersman,
Trapped in suburban England.
And I promise not to overthrow the state
If allowed to redraw the atlas before
I emigrate.
So I have sailed the seven seas alone,

Trying to find a shore I can call home.
But all I found are different flags,
Double-speaking diplomats, and
I do not have time for that.
So I'll declare my own sovereign state,
The borders based on the
Bbottoms of my boots,
And I will open embassies
Wherever the hell I please,
And at assemblies
You will see me sat
But never on my knees.
And I'd glagly leave your 
Metternich's alone as long as where
I lay my head I can be my very own.
I am the Winchester lineman.
I am a frontiersman,
Trapped in suburban England,

I'll ride into the sunset,
My horse waits on the plain,
And I keep walking the line.",After the Rush Hour,Rock

For better worse, wherever

Leave the world behind and start again
Need to find my way back home again

Still stand tempted to throw it all away

They'll just let you be the hollow man you are

"Was it all in real time
Or was it just in my mind
Or was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage
Until I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room

Give me something to dream
Give me half of your bitterest pill
Something from under the surface
You actually feel

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies

The lightest words are heavy
And promises are easy
And no one's ever happy or sad for very long
But just because I said it
It doesn't mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along

I'm just shaping the sound
I'm just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water
And watching you drown

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies

And it's been a long time waiting
And it's been a lifetime in the making

We said when you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid
Was it just a dream, just a dream
Or was it real to me

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same to me
Say these words again and again
And again and again",Again & Again,Rock

Just makes me want to stay inside and wait

That waiting in the throws
Is on a par with reading while my eyes are closed

""what can I do""? you say
""its just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips!""

And kiss your lovers lips

"Call me Ahab, what, monomaniac
Obsessed with success unlike Steve Wozniak
On the hunt for this mammal that once took my leg
With my warn down crew and my man Queequeg
“You're never going to find him!” He's a big sperm whale
“The ocean is enormous!” Shut up, we're setting sail
This scar that you see that runs down my face
Has scarred my soul and inspired this chase
Mental sickness has got me on the run
Full speed ahead! This is American fun
There is wisdom that is woe, so welcome to my life
It was fine until Moby scarred me like a knife
Towards thee I sail, thou unconquering whale
To stab my spear into your white tail
The first one to stop him gets this gold doubloon
Now excuse me while I go be melancholy in my room!

CHORUS
(Got a low low feeling around me)
Bad trip thanks to Moby Dick!
(And a stone cold feeling inside)
Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what!
(And I just can't stop messing my mind up)
Whale crash so fast
(Or wasting my time)
Oh no, oh no!
The ship's got a hole, plug it up, plug it up!

“We're never going to find this white whale,
Are we captain?”

Hey Ishmael… can I call you annoying?
Grown up Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swims so fast and swims so free
With the heaven above, Moby Dick stressing me
And this crazy drenched crew below
Call it idiot pride, or call me Oedipus
My main tragic flaw… “But what about us?”
It's your battle too, crew, man vs. beast
At least have respect as we sail south and east
And north and west, look I'm doing my best
While the rain keeps pouring
we're exhausted and stressed
Pip went insane when he almost drowned,
So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown
Random ships we met warned us of our doom
They said our boat would be our tomb
Near the Mariana Trench, deep and oceanic
We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic

REPEAT CHORUS
I said, “You took my leg, and for that you must die!”
I threw my spear and hit Moby in the eye
He charged the boat, it began to sink
I said, “How about that? Hubris really stinks!”
I didn't think that it would end like this
Pride met fate, this captain got dissed
Let it be a lesson, revenge is never sweet
So I stomp my peg to this Supergrass beat!

"Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] 
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
Would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
Swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
The sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had

A thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
For some time now behind the sultan's back and you
Could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
Dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert

Air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
Which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel sound), 
Which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""
Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)

In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug with...

[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] 
""Rings on her fingers and
Bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken] 
There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
Beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
Bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
Sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,

Watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
Magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
It's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist

Again like we did last summer, baby.!!"" Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
Give him one of the sly looks,
She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

Had another and another one

Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I’m from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm
Oh, I know, I can’t believe
That I'd let it get to me
Good to know I won’t become
Everything I’m afraid of

It’s for the best you didn’t listen

If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Mama don’t cry
I was once your little baby boy
So full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement
Lower than the basement
And I couldn’t stand to smile
I thought of taking my own life
But mama don’t cry
I found songs among the tragic
Hung my hat on sadness
Mom, I think they’re trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I’m ready to free this grand romantic in me

Oh don't underestimate the strength of it
It may be unwise to analyze even the cause of it

Comes an old familiar song you used to know so well
(you know a lot about that)

Maybe it's a matter of fact I just can't grow up
Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
All I really wanna know is there one sweet angel
That can make me smile

I wouldn't budge an inch

A popstar and a model on the side

I know I'll never make it
But tonight I'm good enough to fake it
Bend an imaginary string and break it, replace it
In the backstage of my mind

But I know my friends all think I'm living such a lie
But the lie they think I'm living gets me high
It's the gift that keeps on giving

Close my eyes and see the crowd
But my fingers don't make any sound
My air guitar

Jimmy Page and Brian May
Won't believe the way that I can play
My air guitar

And you think there's nothing there
It's simply made of air
You laugh but you're just scared
Try it if you dare

You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
I can fly in my mind
And you will look better
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?

Throwing peanuts down the aisle
Stupid but it made you smile
You came over for a while
Then you whispered in my ear

The words that I longed to hear
I want you to thrill me here

You can't because you're working
The paparazzo's lurking
You didn't know I'm in a band
In England people know me
One photo's worth a hundred grand

"Lazy days in mid July
Country Sunday mornin's
Dusty haze on summer highways
Sweet magnolia callin'

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in
The Alabama rain

Drive in movies, Friday nights
Drinkin' beer and laughin'
Somehow things were always right
I just don't know what happened

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
When we were walking in
The Alabama rain

We were only kids
But then I've never heard it said
That kids can't fall in love
And feel the same
I can still remember the first time
I told you I love you

On a dusty mid July
Country summer's evenin's
Weepin' willows sang its lullaby
And shared our secret

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in
The Alabama rain

Wait to play the victim
Just run and hide

Wipe the worries away

"Everyday is a new day
I'm thankful for every breath I take
I won't take it for granted
So I learn from my mistakes

It's beyond my control, sometimes it's best to let go
Whatever happens in this lifetime
So I trust in love
You have given me peace of mind

I feel so alive for the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly

Sunshine upon my face
A new song for me to sing
Tell the world how I feel inside
Even though it might cost me everything

Now that I know this, so beyond, I can't hold this
I can never turn my back away
Now that I've seen you
I can never look away

I feel so alive for the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly

Now that I know you (I could never turn my back away)
Now that I see you (I could never look away)
Now that I know you (I could never turn my back away)
Now that I see you (I believe no matter what they say)

I feel so alive for the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly

I feel so alive for the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I feel so alive for the very first time
And I think I can fly",Alive,Rock
"It feels so good to breathe the air 
Another spin around the sun 
On this spec of life 
In the universe 
The gift of love 
Is there for everyone 

Angels working over time 
Day or night to hold the hands 
That play all alone 
A baby's born pure to the world 
As the old man lays down his head and closes his eyes
With nothing said 

Every year another promise is made 
A pint of beer raised towards a better day 
Lets find a star, a star to call our own 
And make a wish, maybe we can make it home 

Ain't it good to be alive? 
To feel the sun, strong against your face 
Strawberry blond waves of silky hair 
Spills over me like the milky way 

Ain't it good to be alive? 
Ain't it good to be alive? 

Alive, alive 
Alive, alive

Ain't it good to breathe the air

A little peace of life in everyone

"I'm still alive
Must have been a miracle
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown
It's a fact of life,
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head
You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead

I'm a runaway train on broken track
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins
I'm still alive

Lost in the night
Feeling so invisible
Oh, a dead man walking the wire
I have broke the devils net
That's made of fire
And it's a long way down from the top of the world
You better look around or you gonna get burned

I'm a runaway train on broken track
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
And as the dust wheels look in my eyes
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

The darkest night ain't black enough
To keep the morning light from shinin'
The highest wall ain't tall enough
To keep the smallest man from climbin'

The more it pulls you in
The more you hang on for your life

"I fell in love with a wind-up souvenir
I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you
She sounds like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep
Now that you're gone, she's all that I've left to hold

And I feel so all alone

I thought you might appreciate
The way that she dances
The painted look upon her face
She must have come from the sun
I want to take her through the park
Where she'd tell me I'm all that she wants
If she could even talk

I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired

It makes me think of you
The way she carries the things that remind me of who
We used to be before we became antiques
She's a lot like you
But when I hold her too tight, I know she'll break
She just takes some glue to stay

With nothing on our minds

Left weary and scared

Just wasting all our time

In the gut, in the back, in the face

A face so laced with doubt and daily pain
It used to be mine
A breath so spent on holding up the wait

You made me resign
And trade a dying ember for a flame
Fearing the sound of no one's voice
And nothingness fills the whole

All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away

It used to be mine
A head so full of memories never lived
It used to be mine
And island that the map said wasn't there

You made me resign
And trade a dying ember for a flame
Fearing the sound of no one's voice
The chill of the touch that's never felt
And nothingness fills the whole

You left me here starved and obsessed
With a hunger that begs for you

This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either,
This is L.A.

All I want to do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over
Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an over-sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But,

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over
Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon ,

But, all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun

And I can sing the blues.

We got a thousand bands singin' underground.
Way down in New Orleans it's the same old thing,
Emotional music, a merry old thing.

He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four.
He played upside down, he played inside out,
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail.

Can't get a smell 'cause my nose is blocked.
I'm so high, I can't believe it,

Outside a stockholm cafe at the river's edge we sat and smiled
We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart

I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed

Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad and made me laugh

Going past a scene of gore
Something that had ended here
Then I stopped in at a porno store

And I found among the pictures there
A vision that was very fair
Just a moment from yesteryear
All I could do was stare

I had a date for the eleventh hour
And we took a tour of 'The Seven Horrors'
Plus just one more
Hank the Eighth was a duplicated man

Stay this way, spend each day, with you

There was a time, that I just thought
That I would lose my mind
You came along and then the sun did shine
We started on our way
I do recall that every moment spent
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

I put the past away
I put the past away

All my life, I will carry you through
All my life, between each hour of the passing days

I'm sure you know how much I'd love to share

I guess when I was younger, just a fool at heart
No one else could tell me
The answer for this life of mine

Growing deep inside me
No longer did I want to live alone

But I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me

As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it
Don't me make me promises

Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
It's time for show and tell

'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall

Is it all or are we just friends
Is this how it ends

Could lose it all if you've got no more room
No room inside for me in your life
'Cause I want it all

"I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog
And an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses 
Walking home in the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea

Two priests came round 
Our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach 
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black 
Like a murder of crows

And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea

If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor 
For they shall inherit the earth
One is better to be poor 
Than a fat man in the eye of a needle
As these words were spoken 
I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world,
And how could it be worth having?

And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly,
To the sea.

All this time 
The river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists,
Then how come he never lived here?

Teachers told us
The Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the
Empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled
Till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

In the falling light of a northern sun
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river

"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
If she wasn't so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived back when legends and history collide
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And she's waiting for passion or humour to strike

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
'Til he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said ""It's okay if you cry""
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
He desires to impress his associates
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

[Chorus]
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
That were later defaced, disgraced celluloid
It don't even make sense but you can bet

If she isn't a sweetheart, a plaything or pet
The film turns her into an unveiled threat
Nonsense prevails, modesty fails
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
Our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
They still think they're the gods of antiquity

Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Your bad mood just ties my hands
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
I've done everything I can
Gave all I have

Ever what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons why

You don't help me none
So warn down, so torn up
Still in love

Yeah, what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Woman, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Oh, baby, tell me why",All Your Reasons,Rock
"Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the beat of my heart

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait

I remember when you were a soldier
Now all you do is growing older
I remember when there was light outside

No more time to fight
No more time to realize
Now adjust your feet
Lay down on my knees

Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the beat of my heart

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait

Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the sound, align to the sound
Obey to the chimes of the bells
Align to the sound, align to the sound
Align to the sound of the drums
Align to the sound, align to the sound

Obey to the chimes of the bells
Your time is running away
You got to get going now
Life, it will not wait

"(Allein allein)

He's living in a universe
A heart away
Inside of him there's no one else
Just a heart away
The time will come to be blessed
A heart away
To celebrate his loneliness

Wir sind allein
Allein allein
Allein allein

Allein allein
Allein allein

We look into faces
(Allein allein)
Wait for a sign
(Allein allein)

Wir sind allein
Allein allein
Allein allein

A prisoner behind the walls
A heart away
Wants to lead his universe
Just a heart away
The time has come for us to love
A heart away
To celebrate our loneliness

Wir sind allein
Allein allein
Allein allein

Allein allein
Allein allein

We look into faces
(Allein allein)
Wait for a sign
(Allein allein)

Wir sind allein
Allein allein
Allein allein

Oh

(Allein allein)
(Allein allein)
(Allein allein)

Allein allein
Allein allein
Allein allein

Sind wir allein
Allein allein

Wir sind allein

"I am on a journey to discover what it's like
To be free of all my demons, to be free of all my demons

Contents on the counter, knocked out of their place
A late eighties biker bar, just doing its thing
The drugs from all our parents stuck inside our veins
I traded you for Vicodin, just doing my thing
I used to be a lawyer, now I just talk a lot
I'm the King of Allentown, this parking lot

I am on a journey, to discover what it's like
To be free of all my demons, to be free of all my demons
While it don't effect me, not like it used to
I am on a journey, to discover what it's like
To be free

"Alles
Alles
Alles was irgendwie nützt

Quellnymphen Dionysos
Substanzen Steptanzen
Trommelstöcke Rosenstöcke
Neue Schuhe, schöne Knie
Miracoli 
Hahnemann samt Globuli

Alles
Alles
Alles was irgendwie nützt

Musik für Luftbefeuchter und Celesta
Die Flasche, der Turm, der Mond und Aspirin
Pilze, die sich finden lassen
Wechselstrom, bewegte Massen
Ein frischbezogenes Bett, Fleckenteufel und Vanilin
Zuckerguss Energierhaltungssatz
Zungenkuss in Schäferstunden
Alles wird neu erfunden

Alles
Alles
Alles was irgendwie nützt

Alles was ist, was war, war nicht genug
wird neu erfunden
Alles was war, war als Erklärung für die Katz
Die ganze Welt entsäuert und entsteint
gebrannt, destilliert und als ""Carpe Diem""
Der Weltbrannt, von uns gierig konsumiert
Auf Abusus folgt der Kater
Das ist Usus
Aber als Erklärung für die Katz
Für mich und die Baccantinnen
bleibt der Rausch ein Muss

Zungenkuss in Schäferstunden
