"It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Feelin' sad really gets bad

"And the churches won't stretch out through tarmac of flyovers,
The city don't smell like they said in the brochures,
And it's no longer surprising when lovers and lawyers, they lie,

Well we've had our problems but hey hasn't everyone?
As soon as they're gone we just drag in another one,
'Cause I see that your upset but you say there's a lash in your eye,
And I'll gladly put up with your shit â??til the day that I die.

Yeah well, I get the feeling I'm just not cut out for this,
All strategy's, hidden agendas and politics,
But if we can stand before legions of enemies, just you and I,

Long as stars are in the blue,
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing,
I'll go on loving you.

Till the end of time,
Long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will grow deeper,
With every passing day.

Till the wells run dry,
And each mountain disappears,
I'll be there for you, to care for you,
Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,

"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot, now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot, Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

"Living on through politics 
Body-guarded, heart in bits 
A blue-eyed honesty 
Indigo injury 
The family tree is felled 
Bereavement worn so well 
Giving up on certainty 
Wilderness society 

Wearing the fame like a loaded gun 
Tied up with a rosary 
I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

Imagine being a Kennedy 
Rule without remedy 
To watch your family die 
The world loves a sacrifice 
Prophets longing for the three 
Honoring the tragedy 
They hunger for the crime 
The privilege to take a life 

Wearing the fame like a loaded gun 
Tied up with a rosary 
Ooh, I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

And is not peace basically 
A matter of human rights? 
The right to live out our lives 
Without fear of devastation? 
The right to breathe air 
As nature provided it? 
The right of future generations 
To a healthy existence? 
Let us if we can step back from 
The shadows of war and seek out 
The way of peace

I love the look in your eyes 
I can see your soul sometimes and we laugh 
When we try too hard we stop and start 
Oh imagine being a Kennedy 
I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

Wearing the fame like a loaded gun 
Tied up with a rosary 
I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

Imagine being a Kennedy 
Ooh I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy 

The cost of freedom is always high, 
Yet one path we shall never choose 
That is the path of surrender or submission.

The scriptures tell us, 
He maketh even his enemies 
To be at peace with him'. 
We will not prematurely or unnecessarily 
Risk the course of worldwide nuclear war 
In which even the fruits of victory 
Would be ashes in our mouths

Ashes in our mouths

And he's playing the part

Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says, I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very, very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want

To tame a troubled land

Return that fateful night, oh that night
When nothing she said could keep her man
From going out to fight

From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other
Only one returns

E la luna bussò

Disse non e più tempo

Su champagne e caviale e se ne andò

E allora giu senza bussare

E allora giu fra stracci e amore
Dove e un lusso la fortuna
C'è bisogno della luna

It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

No competition and no jealousy
Living in freedom and humanity

Why is it now i don't want to be here
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall
God, how i wish that this dream would go on

De poco le sirve al navegante
Que no sepa esperar

"You got a certain way I swear of sticking it in
Even though you only ever lose or you win
I always said I'd wait and wait and wait just to see
But I've been waiting here since nineteen-seventy-three

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

Looking back in time right now to seventy-two
I remember all the stupid things we'd do
Sitting 'round and speeding like its seventy-nine
There was always somewhere else I had to be in my mind
Swimming in my mind
Swimming in my mind
Swimming in my mind
In an electric sky
Looking below
Well, it changed my dreams
And now nothing is quite what it seems

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

It only happens elsewhere
It only happens elsewhere

You got a certain way I swear
Of sticking it there
Ridiculously obvious
And never less aware
I always said I'd wait and wait and wait just to see
I've been waiting here since nineteen-seventy-three

"Retrouverez pas, vous n'me retrouverez pas 
D'ailleurs je dors bien planqué là bas 
Loin des villes, jeté de tout bord 
Où la lumière en éclat 
Ravive de faux décors 
Pour qu'on n's'endorme pas 

Tandis qu'en silence d'or 
Ceux qui marchent au pas 
Passent d'étrange accords 
De l'argent dans la voix 

Ils ne dormiront jamais, jamais 
N'écoutant du disque qu'une face rayée 
Ils ne dormiront jamais, jamais 
Glissant dans leur veine des boissons bleues 

Sous les lumières sauvage de ma liseuse 
Je peux revoir le rêve glisser au fil des cieux
Retrouverez pas, vous n'me retrouverez pas 
Ailleurs je dors bien planqué là bas",1982,Pop

Nous avons vu l’apparition
Du moteur Ford à explosion
Puis de l’avion à réaction

C’est sans doute la bombe à neutrons
Qui nous laissa le plus baba
Au cours du célèbre Hiroshima

Devrait nous laisser tous gagas

C’est l’heure de la médiatisation

Du jogging et de la cigarette
La preuve en est nos beaux soldats

Bronzés à la vitamine d
Nourris aux fibres équilibrées

Seront en bonne santé je crois

Celles des salons, les danseuses
Et celles des cuisines et des balcons, les parleuses
Elle, c'était une parleuse

Elle avait de la bouteille,
C'était très agréable d'ailleurs de parler avec elle
Le genre elle était jamais vraiment loin de toi
Pendant toute la soirée
C'est la coïncidence heureuse des filles
Qui provoquent l'occasion sans trop la provoquer
Abordent sans déborder
D'une façon prudente et silencieuse

Et tout s'accélère quand elle parle
C'est comme un appât qu'elle vous tendait avec ses cils
Elle vous a ferré et son arme réside dans sa manière de vous relancer
Sa cible, vous séduire
En commençant par vous faire rire
Quelques naïves confessions vous permettent de penser
Qu'elle n'est pas maladroite en talons compensés comme simple tenue
Et que vous seriez sûrement très bien tous nus
Et même si c'est déjà vendu,
Même si l'évidence est rendue,
On traîne souvent longtemps sur le palier de la séduction 
Avant de se hisser vers un enlacement salivaire
Quand on est une dragueuse de cuisine et de balcon, on préfère

Les danseuses, elles, sont plus franches du collier
On se séduit, d'accord, mais pour vite s'embrasser
Et là je sais qui y'aura rien
Jusqu'à ce qu'en trois minutes j'ai entre mes mains ses seins
Et au bout de ma langue, cht

Pas de marmots en bas-âge, de maison dans le Vaucluse, et, surtout, pas de mari

Donde guardo los momentos que no olvidé

Olvidamos lo demás,

Vimos bostezar,
Se ha perdido entre la gente,

Un ayer

I've got 3 chains o' gold

Melt down, no, they will never

Give back the chains, if you don't you will die
Nothing should come between you and I

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine forever
If one of us has to go
You will go before me

If one of us has to go (3 chains o' gold)

You will go before me, baby (they will shine forever)

"Was I wrong to think that you
Could live like I'm accustomed to?
Your daddy's rich, you could have married
A millionaire or dignitary
But you chose me; are you happy?
Or sometimes is your mind...

CHORUS:
3000 miles away, 3000 miles away
To a life that could have been?
A wife you could have been
I can just give you love, but is that good enough?

When there's a tear in your eye
It makes me almost want to die
I think of what you threw away
To live hand to mouth from day to day
And I wonder, do you think of it too?
Or sometimes is your mind...

So I must love you a little bit more, kiss you a little bit more
Hope you're satisfied so you won't wander...

Shout out, It's raining green,
Don't tell lies in heaven or an angel will get mean,

Watch how fast they will soar,

And we're driving fast 'till we're plum out of gas

My pit bull friend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well, light a ale
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls 'em off, starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

Are you sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy mother fucka from the mid west
With a Mississippi flow and all in dress
And a four by four with the alter steps
Doing donuts underneath the old chest
I need a chick on time 'cause mine be early
Think I ride or I die down to six thirty
Straight up chick like twelve o'clock
I don't know where yet, that's what she tell the cops
Sits down for a nigga, raise her hand for a nigga
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
To the judge, he the one I love
Hell they can't tell, she don't even budge
Round and round we go
Don't stop 'till I tell you so

Toujours le sourire aux lèvres

J'ai 20 ans
Dans un monde où l'amour crève 
Je m'accroche à mes valeurs sans jamais demander de trêve
J'aurai toujours 20 ans

Dans les yeux de ma mère, ma mère
Chacune de ses larmes me pousse à la rendre fière, ma mère

J'ai 20 ans, et j'ai la vie dont tout le monde parle
Petit bout de femme je suis venue rapper ma flamme
Mes 20 ans
Moi je les ai vécus dans l'ombre
Avec pour seul envie l'amour et puis de dévorer le monde
Mais je n'aurais jamais 20 ans dans les yeux de mon père
Mon père, chacune de ses absences me pousse à la rendre fière, ma mère

Jusqu'au jour où ils te volent tes 20 ans
Malgré le temps qui te cogne

A la vie et à la mort
Si ça peut prouver qu'ils ont tort
Qu'ils ont tort de croire qu'à 20 ans
Tous les jeunes rêvent encore

A 20 ans
Tu te mets à aimer la vie, c'est l'âge libre
T'a du vice devant les risques t'esquives
T'as 20 ans et t'as la force des vainqueurs
Et puis rien ne te fait peur car on t'as déjà crevé le cœur
T'as la vingtaine et t'es perdu sur la planète

"A certain smile, a certain face 
Can lead an unsuspecting heart 
On a merry chase 
Afleeting glance can say 
So many lovely things 
Suddenly you know why my heart sings 

You love awhile and when love goes 
You try to hide the tears inside 
With a cheerful pose

Exactly like a bitter sweet refrain 
Comes that certain smile 
To haunt your heart again",A Certain Smile,Pop

Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?

I wasn't told you'd be this cold

I'll quote on the road like a twat and wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
When you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of a cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart
I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh, I just had a change of heart

Then she said, I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, this is how it starts

Barbecue chicken, won't you send it down the line?

Say, everyone's talking 'bout chicken
Chicken's a popular word
But anywhere you go, you're bound to find
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird

Some people call it a fowl
That's the story I heard
But let 'em call it this and let 'em call it that
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird

You can boil it, roast it, broil it
Cook it in a pan or a pot
Eat it with potatoes, rice or tomatoes
But chicken's still what you got, boy

It was a dish for old Caesar
Also King Henry the Third
But Columbus was smart, said, ""you can't fool me
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird""

Where's the fun of a job well done, or a prize you've won?

"I'd like to say
A few words
In defense of our country
Whose people aren't bad
Nor are they mean
Now, the leaders we have
While they're the worst that we've had
Are hardly the worst
This poor world has seen

Let's turn history's pages, shall we?

Take the Caesars, for example
Why, with the first few of them
They were sleeping with their sister, stashing little boys in swimming pools, and burning down the city
And one of 'em, one of 'em appointed his own horse to be Counsel of the Empire
That's like vice president or something
That's not a very good example right now, is it?
But here's one:
Spanish Inquisition
That's a good one
Put people in a terrible position
I don't even like to think about it
Well, sometimes I like to think about it

Just a few words
In defense of our country
Whose time at the top
Could be coming to an end
Now, we don't want their love
And respect at this point's pretty much out of the question
But in times like these
We sure could use a friend

Hitler
Stalin
Men who need no introduction

King Leopold of Belgium, that's right
Everyone thinks he's so great
Well, he owned the Congo
He tore it up too
Took the diamonds
Took the silver
Took the gold
You know what he left 'em with?

Malaria

You know, a president once said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself""
Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid
It's patriotic, in fact
Color-coded
What we supposed to be afraid of?
Why, of being afraid
That's what terror means, doesn't it?
That's what it used to mean

You know, it pisses me off a little that this Supreme Court's gonna outlive me
Couple young Italian fellas and a brother on the Court now too
But I defy you, anywhere in the world, to find me two Italians as tight ass as the two Italians we got
And as for the brother
Well, Pluto's not a planet anymore either

The end of an empire
Is messy at best
And this empire's ending
Like all the rest
Like the Spanish Armada
Adrift on the sea
We're adrift in the land of the brave
And the home of the free

And how are you upon this bright
And sunny morning
I hear your brother Ted
Got caught for speeding
But was let off with a warning
I hope he's learnt his lesson
And the next time he goes out will drive with care
It doesn't pay to drive too fast
All it does is make your life last shorter

I know you won't believe this
But it happens to be true
I am a loner
My only real companion is dog I'm very fond of
His name's Homer
He follows me wherever I go
And of course I do my best to feed him

They're broader

Do what you want to within reason
But remember take your time
Nothing stops for those
Who can't afford to wait
The best advice that I can give you
Is to hold on to your head
And as long as you are good and kind
You'll always be a friend of mine
And it's true to say that a good friend is hard to find
But I'd like to think that you are

And how are you today
Tell me is that your mother
She looks a lot like you
Though come to think of it
You look like one another

They said that I was like my dad
Now they say that I'm just like his daughter

We've just met
Just how lucky can one boy get
There's a light in your eye
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy

Tell your mom tell your pa
And tell your favourite old wishing star
We're in love, just by chance
I asked you would like to dance
Fancy dancing with a girl like you

"I hear a lot of stories, I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do for you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

Well I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is hard to find

And a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame it on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say that

That a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will be worth it in the end

True love, the lasting kind

"This snowman is shaping up to be an eight but not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they break though these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains

I'm living proof, it can last a long time, now the girls up
The street are innocent and sweet while their all in bed
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland

Sprinkled inside their heads soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood hills never seem so strange
Their mothers pray it will last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled
I wanna wish you merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho

Now the boys are all grown up
And there working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone

I've been raking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up
I pray to God, it don't last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I wanna wish you merry Christmas
Can't do that

Can't do that",A Great Big Sled,Pop

Where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
Stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in a mouth of a graveyard

I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
A white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

What'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm goin' back out 'fore the rain starts fallin'
Walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where people are many and their hands are all empty
Where pellets of poison are flooding the waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountains so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand in the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

"A Honolulu

Je me souviens d'un beau pays
Ou j'ai cru trouver le bonheur,
Mais il y fait trop chaud la nuit
Et les jardins ont trop de fleurs.

REFRAIN

Nous nous sommes connus
Un beau soir dans la rue,
Quand vous êtes venue
A Honolulu,
Et nous avons dansé
La nuit sous les palmiers,
Qu'il faisait bon l'été
A Honolulu
Là, je vous ai donné
Notre premier baiser,
Mais jamais le dernier
A Honolulu,
Quand on s'est embrassés
La lune s'est cachée
Et tout s'est transformé
A Honolulu,
Seuls, tous les deux sur la plage,
Seuls, seuls avec notre amour,
Le ciel était jaloux
De notre rendez-vous,
Car on est un peu fou
A Honolulu.
Si vous allez un jour
Dans ce divin séjour,
Vous trouverez l'amour
A Honolulu.

On s'aime vite à Hawaï
Car tout le monde a le coeur chaud,
L'amour est roi dans ce pays
Mais tout ce passe comme il faut.

Nous nous sommes aimés
Et c'est un vieux curé
Qui nous a marié
A Honolulu,
Notre première nuit
Ne fut que frénésie,
Fantaisies et folies
A Honolulu,
Mais dès le lendemain
Vous aviez pris le train,
Je vous cherchais en vain
A Honolulu,
Et deux trois jours après
Nous étions divorcés,
Simple formalité
A Honolulu.
Seul, maintenant par le monde
Seul, je cours après l'amour,
Mais j'ai bien des regrets
Au souvenir passé
Du jour ou vous m'aimiez
A Honolulu.
Et je voudrais un jour

"A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there,

You can kiss goodnight...

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us
Are far apart
An' one of us
Has a broken heart...

Now an' then
I call your name
An' suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends
It ends in tears...

Darling have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When i climb the stair
An' turn the key
Oh please be there
Still in love with me...

"A house with love in it is rich indeed
Although there are a thousand things that house may need
The carpet may be old, the room so plain and bare
And yet it's beautiful somehow, when love is living there
A house with love in it just seems to bloom
As though the month of May were filling every room
So, darling, through the years with all my heart I'll pray
A house with love in it is where we'll stay

"A kiss is the touch of summer's fingertips
A kiss means so much
When April rain is in your eyes
The autumn dies with no goodbyes to say

A kiss will stay with you
And what your heart has longed to touch
Two willing lips can tell so well
They tell how lovely love can be

Not in words but you'll see by a kiss
The reason story books must end with a kiss
It means that life has just begun
That love has won, that kissing's fun

We know but time will show
It's much more than this
It all depends on whom you'll kiss

But you'll see by a kiss

"A kiss goodnight is alright
But remember this
That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
A kiss goodnight with a hug real tight
Is nothing short of bliss
And a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss

In some secluded place

As to do a turn about face
So it just ain't right to kiss goodnight
And stop at 3 or 4

"Todo fue un cuento de mil una noches 
Solo un poema de amor y ternura 
Nos envidiaba hasta el mar que jugaba 
A esconderse allá en las dunas

Tanto vagar por las noches de luna 
Era un andar por arenas doradas 
Eran dos almas de amor entregadas 
Que de quererse jamás 
Se cansaban

Tuvo en la arena su lecho de espuma 
Que hizo por techo un cielo estrellado 
Y aun que fue mía una noche en verano 
Ya rendida me engañaba 

Todo fue engaño y falsas promesas 
Solo mentiras que lindas mentiras 
Era su cuerpo cual fruta de mayo 
Que en otros brazos también maduraba 

Donde estás ahora

And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,Pop

Like a bird, you left your robin's nest and-a just like all the rest you flew away

Of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years

Wedding bells just turn to rust

You had a wife, two children
And a beautiful house
And me, well you wanted me

When it suited your needs
And now, now I have nothing
Just a handful of faded photographs
Nothing but a cold empty heart

But I'm not easily forgotten
I'll appear when you least expect
To make you pay
You asked for it that way

Write poison letters to your wife
Totally destroy your life

Drag your name through the dirt
Make sure that it really hurts

"What if you reached the age of reason
Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just have to leave
We measure our days out
In steps of uncertainty
Not turning to see how we've come
And peer down the highway
From here to eternity
And reach out for love on the run
While the man for all seasons
Is lost behind the sun

To bring good news in his hour of doubt
While Thomas More waits in the Tower of London
Watching the sands running out
And measures the hours out

A sailor through the darkness
He scans the meridian
And caught by the first rays of dawn
The man for all seasons
Is lost beneath the storm

And I should know by now
I should know by now
I hear them call it out all around
Oh, they go
There's nothing to believe in
Hear them,
Just daydreams, deceiving
They'll just let you down

What if you reached the age of reason
Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just disbelieve?

We measure our gains out in luck and coincidence
Lanterns to turn back the night
And put our defeats down to chance or experience
And try once again for the light
Some wait for the waters of fortune to cover them
Some just see the tides of ill chance running over them

Some call on Jehovah
Some cry out to Allah
Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhalla
Well, you should try to accept what the fates are unfolding
While some say they're sure where the blame should be falling

"It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year 'round

Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze

Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along

Oh, it's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world

Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti

Aun así logro sentir

Y tus latidos
Y cada vez
Se me haré más difícil cada vez
Y es que sin ti

Y no encuentro salida sin ti

Solo te llamaba por saber
Si por si acaso tu también
Necesitabas

Every anguished cry

Frightened and alone

The cities charred and ruined
The herds of homeless people
Filling all the roads

Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Bullets paint the blue distance
The mirror's stained from every gun
Still, I say that it glistens
In the heart of everyone

And there are golden whispers
Within the afternoon
They've held the brothers, sisters
Felt the mothers' wounds
The broken-hearted people
Burying their own

Some may pray to their mirrors
Some may kneel before the sun

Light the candle, and we're shown

Set the coffeemaker for 6 a.m.
Sewed a loose button on brother's shirt for him

Checked sister's math homework, sent a note to the teacher
Added eggs to the grocery list
Started a load of wash, made sure the doors were locked
Put water in the puppy's dish
Wrote a check to the children's piano teacher
Turned the dishwasher on

For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is

Hung some art on the refrigerator door
And headed up the stairs
Kissed all the children and helped sister comb

Washed her make-up off and turned on the bath
Lay down in the moon's soft light and kissed Dad goodnight

Much wealthier than I

Where they rack up the balls for the games
And reputations are made
There's a green forest full of oaks and pines
Where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
Where secret scores are settled
And the claim was made round the table that night

And how one man fell to his knees

Est aussi de la fête

Comme on faisait l'amour

How young how fair
How it felt to see you there

And the wine of life was sweet
And at times our eyes would meet

He may learn to give his heart for love,

Will be memories of paradise

Or do they sit and sigh, ""Aye Aye!""?

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?
And whadda they do when it's murky
In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

But whadda they do when skies are dreary
Along Lake erie?
And whadda they do in St Louis
When nights are dewy?
And whadda they do in Colorado
When a shadow dims the light?

"I crossed on the river 
There'll be no returning 
I crossed all the bridges 
I watched them all burning 
And now I'm a stranger 
To a strange land I'm driven 
Where all is forgotten 
And nothing's forgiven

Than I'll ever swim

The sorrow will dim 
But I cried a river 
A river for him 

I think of him now 
On the road I am taking 
And wonder how long 
His heart will be breaking 
But he'll never hear when 
The teardrops are falling 
Or the sound of my voice 
And the name I'm calling 

But I cried a river 
A river for him 
That's deeper and wider 
Than I'll ever swim 
The heart it will harden 
The sorrow will dim 
But I cried a river 
A river for him 

So sweep for the sons 
And the dear darling daughters 
For the passing of time 
And the parting of waters 
For all who have passed through 
This world long before me 
To a far distant shore line 
Where no one waits for me

"How many times have you heard someone say 
""If I had his money, I could do things my way?"" 
Little they know that it's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind. 

Once I was winning in fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game 
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Every minute, every hour, every day

Ci fa volare dentro l'aria

A thousand times a million doors to eternity

To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,

I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame,
This single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
I still love you
I still want you

Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves

Jaqueamos la inteligencia

La de los altos telones
No es nada más
Que un anhelo de dos

Out on the California coast

Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose

But we came pretty close

I have to leave you
On the California coast

Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than the California coast

Were just too grandiose

Pitch the pennies in the fountain.

I promise I'll be good. 
I'll be waiting by the window, 
I'll be sitting in the dark.

Plugging in my circuits. 
Dancing in my brain.

The feeling of seclusion makes you wanna dream away and fall in love

What wrong with you, don't let her go

That fills your ears when your little world starts coming around

Nor to care to bring some coolness on the sheets two lovers share

To a man I've never even met

Take me for a pirate's wife 
Take me where the wind blows 
Take me where the red wine flows 
Take me to the danger 
Take me to the life of crime 
Take me to the stars 
Take me to the moon while we still have time

And now that our fathers have gone
And we've been left to carry on

Is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness
And if we look behind us there's a wind blowing in

"(intro: Arabian flute)

Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand
He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
the sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had
a thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
for some time now behind the sultan's back and you
could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert
air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel
sound), which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""

Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)
In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug
With
[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] ""Rings on her fingers and
bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken]   There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,
watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
it's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist
again like we did last summer, baby.!!""  Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
give him one of the sly looks,

She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

('round and around and around and around, and around and around and around)

Yeah, and that's the story 'bout Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burnin' sand
Ahab the Arab, the swingin' sheik of the burnin' sand",Ahab the Arab,Pop
"Ah ha, ha-ah-ah

Left you, falling on the floor
Headed for the door
Went straight to Philidelphia
Oh no, what have I begun?
Called my mother, said I love her
Had another and another one
Questions, questions, suddenly suggestions
Where was anyone at the start of this thing?
Hold that gold up over your shoulder
All I needs a place to grieve

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Now I’m over my head
Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I’m from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm
Oh, I know, I can’t believe
That I'd let it get to me
Good to know I won’t become
Everything I’m afraid of

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Mama don’t cry
I was once your little baby boy
So full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement
Lower than the basement
And I couldn’t stand to smile
I thought of taking my own life
But mama don’t cry
I found songs among the tragic
Hung my hat on sadness
Mom, I think they’re trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I’m ready to free this grand romantic in me
La -Di Da, La Di Da, La Di Da

Look out, look out!
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah, Ah ha, ha-ah-ah
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah, Ah ha, ha-ah-ah
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah…

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

"Desde que empezamos juntos a ser pareja
En el juego de tu amor sólo fui una pieza
Y luché por ganar y ser algo más

"Probablemente en su pueblo se les recordará 
Como cachorros de buenas personas, 
Que hurtaban flores para regalar a su mamá 
Y daban de comer a las palomas. 

Probablemente que todo eso debe ser verdad, 
Aunque es más turbio cómo y de qué manera 
Llegaron esos individuos a ser lo que son 
Ni a quién sirven cuando alzan las banderas. 

Hombres de paja que usan la colonia y el honor 
Para ocultar oscuras intenciones
Tienen doble vida, son sicarios del mal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Rodeados de protocolo, comitiva y seguridad, 
Viajan de incógnito en autos blindados 
A sembrar calumnias, a mentir con naturalidad, 
A colgar en las escuelas su retrato. 

Se gastan más de lo que tienen en coleccionar 
Espías, listas negras y arsenales
Resulta bochornoso verles fanfarronear 
A ver quién es el que la tiene más grande. 

Se arman hasta los dientes en el nombre de la paz, 
Juegan con cosas que no tienen repuesto 
Y la culpa es del otro si algo les sale mal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Y como quien en la cosa, nada tiene que perder. 
Pulsan la alarma y rompen las promesas 
Y en nombre de quien no tienen el gusto de conocer 
Nos ponen la pistola en la cabeza. 

Se agarran de los pelos, pero para no ensuciar 
Van a cagar a casa de otra gente 
Y experimentan nuevos métodos de masacrar, 
Sofisticados y a la vez convincentes. 

No conocen ni a su padre cuando pierden el control, 
Ni recuerdan que en el mundo hay niños. 
Nos niegan a todos el pan y la sal. 
Entre esos tipos y yo hay algo personal. 

Pero, eso sí, los sicarios no pierden ocasión 
De declarar públicamente su empeño 
En propiciar un diálogo de franca distensión 
Que les permita hallar un marco previo 

Que garantice unas premisas mínimas 
Que faciliten crear los resortes 
Que impulsen un punto de partida sólido y capaz 
De este a oeste y de sur a norte, 

Donde establecer las bases de un tratado de amistad 
Que contribuya a poner los cimientos 
De una plataforma donde edificar

So just hold on tight in this walk of life

And tear down my walls
So we can let every single barrier fall
I'm losing my layers, I'm letting you know
So won't you come back into me where you belong
Won't you come back into me where you belong

"""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

[Chorus:]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

[Chorus:]

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell ya, that your the only one

You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,
And we went together like the summer in June
But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon

Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile,
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
But you showed me different and I know better now,
I gotta get you out my system somehow

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

Put you on a pedestal, girl I held you so high
Was never too good at finding the words to describe,
Just how I felt for you but you know that I tried,
But somehow we went and changed inside

You damn near were my everything you're still on my mind,
But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin' just fine
Gotta take it back to the days before we met
And live our lives as strangers again

When you went away, I can't help but wonder
Was he worth my pain, you should know better, and I should've too
And I cried, and you cried and we tried to make it work,
Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,
If I could do it again, I would be a better man,

Like an angel from above

But this girls been a block or two
Just about time for someone new
What she really means by how d'ya do
Is boy I'm gonna walk all over you

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Pretty litle boy for a week or two
Gonna break your heart and it won't recover
Leaving you all bitter and blue

You gout so much to say but
She just don't wanna hear
Shell leave you bills to pay
And you crying in your beer

Well it's no use thinking it's a honeymoon
All your gonna hear from now till noon
Just a broken man in a rented room
Keep playing that lady's favourite tune

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Gonna go right out and find some other
Do the same thing that she did to you
But she needs to know that you'll always love her
Like a harem in a desert sea
In her big black book gonna put your number
Let your love sink in a sea of dreams

there's a place that she left long ago (goodbye girl)
Where a boy used her only for show (goodbye girl)
Came the time for the end of her world
Told her thank you but now it's goodbye, it's goodbye
Goodbye girl

Well it's no use thinking it's a honeymoon
All you're gonna hear from now till noon
Just a broken man in a rented room
Keep playing that lady's favourite tune

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Pretty little boy for a week or two
Gonna go right out and find some other
Do the same thing that she did to you

But she needs to know that you'll always lover her
Like a harem in a desert sea
In her big black book gonna out your number
All she wants

Its been goodbye all along - goodbye all along

"One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh
One went out in an English park
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen
Little lights in my heart

One went out when I lied to my mother
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine
One went out within me
Now I smoke like a chimney
It's getting dark in this heart of mine
It's getting dark in this heart of mine

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart
One dies when it moves away

One went out in the back streets of Manchester
One went out in an airport in Spain
One went out, have no doubt
When I grew up and moved out
Of the place where the boy used to play

One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor
We used to fish and I fish no more
Though we will not return
I know one still burns
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore

We're born with millions
Of little lights shining in the dark
And they show us the way
One lights up every time we feel love in our hearts
One dies when it moves away

Of little lights shining in our hearts
And they die along the way
Till we're old and we're cold
And we're lying in the dark

J'entends ton chant monotone
La nuit frissonne {Allan Allan}
J'entends ton cœur fatigué
D'avoir aimé {Allan Allan}

D'étranges rêveries comptent mes nuits
D'un long voyage où rien ne vit
D'étranges visions couvrent mon front
Tout semble revêtu d'une ombre
L'étrange goût de mort

Saoule mon âme jusqu'à l'aurore
L'étrange Ligeria renaît en moi
De tout mon être je viens vers toi!

Tu meurs ce soir {Allan Allan}

De tes tourments? {Allan Allan}

"Wenn der Abend kommt und die Einsamkeit
Und die Sehnsucht zieht in tausend Herzen ein
Hör dem Nachtwind zu
Er singt ein Lied von mir
Und dann geh zur Ruh
Denn ich bin ja bei dir.
Alle Liebe dieser Erde
Schenk ich dir
Schenk ich dir
Do sollst nie mehr einsam werden
Was auch kommt
Das glaube mir.
Alle Liebe dieser Erde
Findest do allein bei mir
Alle Liebe dieser Erde
Will dafür auch ich von dir.
Wenn der Abend kommt werden Träume wach
Und die Nacht
Sie zündet tausend Lichter an
Bin ich auch fern von dir
Schau zum Himmel auf
Jeder Stern sagt dir
Do sollst nicht traurig sein.
Alle Liebe dieser Erde
Schenk ich dir
Schenk ich dir
Do sollst nie mehr einsam werden
Was auch kommt

"Komm gib auf, komm gib auf, sagt mir mein Verstand

Bevor sie auf mich fall'n, reiß ich die Mauern ein.
Komm steh' auf, komm steh' auf, sag ich mei'm Verstand
Und gibt es keine Tür, dann geh' ich halt durch die Wand.

Mit Feuer bekämpft.

"Did I hear you right
'Cause I thought you said
Let's think it over

You have been my life
And I never planned
Growing old without you

Shadows bleeding through the light
Where a love once shined so bright
Came without a reason

Don't let go on us tonight
Love's not always black and white
Well, haven't I always loved you?

But when I need you
You're almost here
And I know that's not enough

But when I'm with you
I'm close to tears
'Cause you're only almost here

I would change the world
If I had a chance
Oh, won't you let me

Treat me like a child
Throw your arms around me
Please protect me

Bruised and battered by your words
Dazed and shattered how it hurts
Oh, haven't I always loved you

But when I need you
You're almost here
And I know that's not enough

And when I'm with you
I'm close to tears
'Cause you're only almost here

Bruised and battered by your words
Dazed and shattered now it hurts
Haven't I always loved you

But when I need you
You're almost here
(Well, I never knew how far behind I'd left you)

And when I hold you
You're almost here

You'll be resting on my mind
For the last time,
I would leave myself behind
In the evenings
Raise the glass and tell some lies
Make a pass, impress another girl
She's easy on the eyes
She was easy
And so was I

My reflection
In the window when I ride
For Chicago
She is on the other side
Take a picture, Write a letter to my love
Well I was almost honest, I was almost honest

Been a long time
Since I lay with you in bed
Conversations full of words you never said
I got your message
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
I gave into the loneliness but I didn't give her nothing else
Which direction down this highway that I ride
To Atlanta, she is on the other side
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
I was almost honest, well I was almost honest

In the window when I ride
Could not save us but I swear to God I tried
Take a picture

My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me

No words were ever
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark

I'm lost inside the maze

You turn the other way

It's all a game you play

And wake to find you gone

I watch you fade away

To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love

Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night, oh baby
Slowly fall apart without you

Slowly time is passing somehow I get bye
Keeping myself busy
Is my sole occupation
I don't know
What I'm doing
But it fills my mind
Putting off the moment
When I can't escape you baby.
Alone in the night
Me and the memory
Somebody set me free
From someone who used to be.
A part of my night
Woman please let me go
You said godbye
Now here I lie
Alone in the night.
It's lucky I got lovin' friends who come around
Eatin' drinkin' talkin'
About anything out you love
Late night shows in T. V.
When they've all gone home
And then I gotta face it I am dyin' for you baby.
Alone in the Night ...
Lonely days are bad enough but come the night
My heart and I can't fight it
We remember come back we surrender.
Alone in the night
Woman please let me go you said goodbye
Now here I lied alone in the night.

I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fear relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace,Pop
"Clearing road and landslide
Children of history
Changing from the inside
Non just because Che Guevara showed the way
Not just to shame the C.I.A.
Everyone needs to feel at home
Nobody wins who fights alone

Here's to the N.J.M.
Planning for the future
Women and men who dared raise our aspirations
Not just because Maurice Bishop told them to
Not just to change the western view
Everyone needs to feel at home
Nobody wins who fights alone

And here's to our friends like Chris
working in the classrooms
London to Mozambique
Nursing wounds of empire
Not just because revolution paved the way
Not just to be there on the day

Ho preso in mano il mio cuore perché ha perso troppo sangue
A cercare invano le prove di quello che chiamate amore
Ho messo l’anima in pace perché è stata in guerra per troppo tempo
E dopo tutto questo tempo è diventata di cemento
Ho preso a calci il mio cuore perché aveva smesso di battere

Perché la vita mi ha colpito troppe volte alla schiena

Ho messo il vestito migliore per la fortuna che ho di essere vivo

You can find her Sunday
Sitting by a stream
On her own
All alone

The other America
Might show up on Tuesday
At your kitchen door
She will ask politely
Is anybody home?

Or did they all lay down
To sleep through the now?
And if they all lay down
I'll be waiting for them
At the river bed
Once they wake from their rest

The other America
Takes herself to night school
To understand the law
She may bring you questions
When she finds the flaw

Why did they all lay down
To sleep through the now?
And if they all lay down
I'll be waiting for them
At the river bed
Once they wake from their rest

We could be opening a doorway globally
But that's okay
Once upon a time you had faith
You would not be swayed
By fools untouched by clairvoyance
And you swore that we'd be brave
Well not today
No not today

Because we all lay down
To sleep through the now
And if we all lay down
She'll be waiting for us
Where the rivers cross
Once we wake from our rest, all the best",America,Pop

My telephone is off the hook
My eyes are closed I'm scared to look
I bet you're happy now you're free
But what about poor little me
I draw your picture on the wall
My phone is dead and still your call
My mama asked I told her I get by
That's such a lie
I'm going down
Come around
Watch me when I hit the ground
Give me just one fix of your
Your sweet American love
I go blind
Lose my mind
Leave the world I know behind
Just to feel it one last time
My sweet American love
I've kept the things you gave to me
The air is clear but I can't see
And a cheerful radio boasts that "" Love is in the air""
But it's so full of shit
A Sony is it?
So what D'ya you have to leave me for
Was it my hair, was I such a bore
Well you know baby
That you were always my only choice
(goin' down, come around, watch me when I hit the ground)
Gimme just one fix of your, your American love, american love
(I go blind, lose my mind, leave the world I know behind)
Just to feel it one last time

"Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves

Put your hands in the air
Hold on the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity, let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary

"Evaporato in una nuvola rossa
in una delle molte feritoie della notte
con un bisogno d'attenzione e d'amore
troppo, ""Se mi vuoi bene piangi ""
per essere corrisposti,
valeva la pena divertirvi le serate estive
con un semplicissimo ""Mi ricordo"":
per osservarvi affittare un chilo d'erba
ai contadini in pensione e alle loro donne
e regalare a piene mani oceani
ed altre ed altre onde ai marinai in servizio,
fino a scoprire ad uno ad uno i vostri nascondigli
senza rimpiangere la mia credulità:
perché già dalla prima trincea
ero più curioso di voi,
ero molto più curioso di voi.

E poi sospeso dai vostri ""Come sta""
meravigliato da luoghi meno comuni e più feroci,
tipo ""Come ti senti amico, amico fragile,
se vuoi potrò occuparmi un'ora al mese di te""
""Lo sa che io ho perduto due figli""
""Signora lei è una donna piuttosto distratta.""
E ancora ucciso dalla vostra cortesia
nell'ora in cui un mio sogno
ballerina di seconda fila,
agitava per chissà quale avvenire
il suo presente di seni enormi
e il suo cesareo fresco,
pensavo è bello che dove finiscono le mie dita
debba in qualche modo incominciare una chitarra.

E poi seduto in mezzo ai vostri arrivederci,
mi sentivo meno stanco di voi
ero molto meno stanco di voi.

Potevo stuzzicare i pantaloni della sconosciuta
fino a vederle spalancarsi la bocca.
Potevo chiedere ad uno qualunque dei miei figli
di parlare ancora male e ad alta voce di me.
Potevo barattare la mia chitarra e il suo elmo
con una scatola di legno che dicesse perderemo.
Potevo chiedervi come si chiama il vostro cane
Il mio è un po' di tempo che si chiama Libero.
Potevo assumere un cannibale al giorno
per farmi insegnare la mia distanza dalle stelle.
Potevo attraversare litri e litri di corallo
per raggiungere un posto che si chiamasse arrivederci.

E mai che mi sia venuto in mente,
di essere più ubriaco di voi
di essere molto più ubriaco di voi.",Amico Fragile,Pop

Why algún que otro día, sólo cansadas.

Les gusta ser tan altas como la luna, pero también
Volverse pequeñitas como aceitunas.

Que transforman lo eterno en cotidiano
Que conviven sin miedo con la muerte
Que luchan cuerpo a cuerpo con la suerte hasta lograr
Que coma dulcemente de sus manos.

Diosas del agua why de la miel

Lloran sin rabia
Envejecen haciéndose mas sabias
Saben coger la vida por los cuernos, pero también
Correr para no verse en el infierno.

Con su ternura
Funden el corazón de la amargura
Why como todos, quieren que las quieran más, que bien saben
Tener la soledad de compañera.

Que transforman lo eterno en cotidiano
Que conviven sin miedo con la muerte
Que luchan cuerpo a cuerpo con la suerte hasta lograr
Que coma dulcemente de sus manos.

"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine

Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around

It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream

Basta un fiore solo in mezzo a un mucchio di rifiuti
Basta il po' di cielo che quel fumo lascia ancora vedere
Basta il bianco polo, un pelicano sopra spiagge nere
Basta il sole
Ed è ancora bella se piove
Ed è ancora bella fra neve
Ed è ancora bella così
Con le sue stagioni impazzite
È ancora vita
Con le sue foreste sfigurate
È sempre vita, sì!

Si sentiranno le pietre gridare
Si sentiranno le pietre crollare in un attimo

"The nearer we got to Andorra
The sun set on the left
The rounded mountains pointed
To the black clouds in the West 

Hey, there's a darkness
In the sky that's not the night
Hey, there's a rain cloud there
That's shutting out the light 

(Chorus:)
What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

As soon as we reached Barcelona
The cold wind touched the beach
The sun we left in London
Is away beyond our reach 

Hey, I said darling:
It seems a waste of time
Hey, all I do is sit 
And drink our Spanish wine 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

Of all the tales of Granada 
They tell of Islam's run
They lived beneath the Moorish lord
Beneath a Moorish sun

Oh, how we yearned to turn 
Our faces to that glare
When down from the mountains
Came the rain to soak our hair 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain",Andorra,Pop

"The world was dark, he couldn't see the way
Guilt was in his heart
A broken glass in a blood stained hand
A woman with a broken heart
Somehow he knew he'd gotta find a way
Out of this prison cell
He looked up to the familiar skies
For a secret they might tell
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
He left his home and he left his wife
He left his family
But every place that he traveled through
Himself he still could see
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
With no bitter memories
And just at the point he was breaking down
He looked up through the trees
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising

(Can't be true)
Whatever you deny
I'll believe 'cause I love you

I refuse to listen to
All those lies they tell on you
I know better
'Cause angels don't lie",Angels Don't Lie,Pop
"Angels of mercy, there's so much to do
The heavens are gray overhead

Angels of mercy, they're calling to you
So march with your crosses of red

March where the darkness shuts out the light
March where there is no dawn

Angels of mercy, the world's covered with night
But your mercy goes marching on
Angels of mercy through darkest night
Your mercy goes marching on",Angels of Mercy,Pop
"Angie, Angie
When will those dark clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here
With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, Angie

Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
Ain't time we say goodbye
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie

Angie

Angie, I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
Angie, Angie
We can't say we never tried
Angie, Angie, ain't good to be alive
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
Angie, Angie, we can't say we never tried",Angie,Pop
"Deixa, se fosse sempre assim
Quente, deita aqui perto de mim
Tem dias que tudo está em paz
E agora os dias são iguais

Se fosse só sentir saudade
Mas tem sempre algo mais
Seja como for
É uma dor que dói no peito
Pode rir agora
Que estou sozinho
Mas não venha me roubar

Vamos brincar perto da usina
Deixa pra lá
A Angra é dos Reis
Por que se explicar
Se não existe perigo

Senti teu coração perfeito
Batendo à toa e isso dói
Seja como for
É uma dor que dói no peito
Pode rir agora
Que estou sozinho
Mas não venha me roubar
Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

Vai ver que não é nada disso
Vai ver que já não sei quem sou
Vai ver que nunca fui o mesmo
A culpa é toda sua e nunca foi

Mesmo se as estrelas
Começassem a cair
E a luz queimasse tudo ao redor
E fosse o fim chegando cedo
Você visse o nosso corpo
Em chamas!
Deixa pra lá

Quando as estrelas
Começarem a cair
Me diz, me diz
Pr'onde é
Que a gente vai fugir?",Angra Dos Reis,Pop
"Johnny, Angry Johnny, this is Jezebel in Hell
I want to kill you, I want to blow you...away

I can do it you gently
I can do it with an animal's grace
I can do it with precision
I can do it with gormet taste

[Chorus]
But either way
Either (way), either way
I want to kill you
I want to blow you...
Away

I can do it to your mind
I can do it to your face
I can do it with integrity
I can do it with disgrace

[Chorus]

Johnny, Angry Johnny, this is Jezebel in Hell
Johnny, Angry Johnny, this is Jezebel in Hell

I can do it in a church
I can do it any time or place
I can do it like an angel
To quiet down your rage

[Chorus]

I can do it in the water
I can do on dry land
I can do it with instruments
I can do it with my own bare hands

But either way
Either way, you know where it stands
I want to kill you
I want to blow you...
Away

Johnny, Angry Johnny, this is Jezebel in Hell
Johnny, oh my Johnny

Where did your pleasure go
When the pain came through you
Where did your happiness go
This force is running you around now
Getting you down now
Where is your pleasure now Johnny
Where has your pleasure gone now

Johnny, Angry Johnny...",Angry Johnny,Pop
