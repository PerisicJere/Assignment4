"I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad

If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
And I'll be glad

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands

If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
I've got my man

Someday I know he's coming
Back to call me
He's gonna handle me
And hold me so

It's going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes, I know
I'll have to go

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad

If you can keep me
I want to stay here
With you forever
I've got my man",(I Love You) Porgy,Blues
"My blue horizon is turning gray
And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says ""No, no, you're not the same""

I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over",(I'm Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over,Blues

"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a six
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night

Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Is this the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night

"Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I watch 'em roll away again

[Refrain]
Sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I had nothin to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way

So I'm just...
[Refrain]

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just...",(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,Blues
"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I Straddled that Greyhound,
and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' out of Georgia state

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate

Swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten O nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line",(Th Promised Land,Blues
"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you

I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world",(What A) Wonderful World,Blues
"As her car pulls out the driveway
And she don’t wave goodbye
Her last words echo in my mind
Listen honey, I gotta get away

I’m standing here watching her tail lights
As if they’re some kind of sign
Fading into a memory
I just got tired of trying

So long, I hate to see you go
So I save my tears for later on down the road
How come I keep I holding on
Knowing you won’t be coming home

Two days later I get a letter
A picture of a room in some hotel
Sitting framed up on the table,
A picture I know so well
You’ve painted yourself in to a corner
Now you’re trying to paint something new
And your lipstick on the letter
Is a goodbye kiss from you

So long, I hate to see you go
So I save my tears for later on down the road
How come I keep I holding on
Knowing you won’t be coming home

I still set the table
Still set it for you and me
It’s become a habit
My own personal make believe

So long, I hate to see you go
So I save my tears for later on down the road
How come I keep I holding on
Knowing you won’t be coming home

So long, I hate to see you go

"Can you see me, cryin'?, Can you hear me, dyin'?
I wanna talk to you, listen too
Do you know me like I know you?
Do you love me like I love you? Is it all the same, yeah

We'll be old friends, tryin', till the road ends, we'll be flyin'
Listen to me, sing to you, I got the music, I need the space
I'd like to use it to get out of this place
'Cause it's all the same, yeah

I got the miserables, help me, don't seem sensible, tell me
I wanna talk to you, listen too
Too many times I've swallowed my words
Is it a crime to want to be heard? If it's all the same, yeah",12/8 Blues (All the Same),Blues
"Plugged sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
And the Black Crow snuck through a hole in the sky
So I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule
And I made me a ladder from a pawnshop marimba
And I leaned up against a dandelion tree
Leaned up against a dandelion tree
Leaned up against a dandelion tree

I'm gonna cook them feathers on a tiny spit
And I filled me a sachel full of old pig corn
And I beat me a billy from an old French horn
And I kicked that mule to the top of the tree
Kicked that mule to the top of the tree
Blew me a hole 'bout the size of a kickdrum
And I cut me a switch from a long branch elbow

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six

Well, I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed
And I tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three
Well, you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
With the strings of a Washburn stretched like a clothesline
Oh, you know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six

Now I hold him prisoner in a Washburn jail
That I strapped on the back of my old kick mule
Strapped him on the back of my old kick mule
Bang on the strings just to drive him crazy
Oh, I strum it loud to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage

Oh, I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six,Blues
"Atlanta's a distant memory
Montgomery a recent birth
And Tulsa burns on the desert floor
Like a signal fire

I got Willie on the radio
A dozen things on my mind
And number one is fleshing out
These dreams of mine

I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line
Before I sleep
But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms
To fall into tonight

In Nashville there is a lighter
In a case for all to see
It speaks of dreams and heartaches
Left unsung

And in the corner stands a guitar and
Lonesome words scrawled in a drunken hand
I don't travel past, travel hard before
And I'm beginning to understand

That I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line
Before I sleep
But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms
To fall into tonight

They say that I am crazy
My life wasting on this road
That time will find my dreams
Scared or dead and cold

But I heard there is a light
Drawing me to reach an end
And when I reach there, I'll turn back
And you and I can begin again

I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line
Before I sleep
But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms
To fall into tonight

I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt in line
Before I sleep
But I wouldn't trade all your golden tomorrows
For one hour of this night

Atlanta's a distant memory
Montgomery a recent birth
And Tulsa burns on the desert floor

"There's a hero living at 2401 and all around
A family circus in the sun
Got his Mothers working
While you're having fun

Trying to change the system
Many things that must be done
Where did Moon go?
Better call at GTO

In the red room
Pam is planning where to go
Gail and Pauline
Who is prowling round your door?

A maniac, The Raven
Could he have his gun back?
No! 2401, got myself a place to stay
On the railroad, Kansas nearer every day

Looking very gay

How do you ever tear yourself away?",2401,Blues

"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
Then said, ""What else you got left?""
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, ""Don't forget,
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""

I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum
I asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, ""No, dear.""
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red,
Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then, you never wasted time.
And I, I never took much,
I never asked for your crutch
And I don't ask for mine.",4th Time Around,Blues
"It took five women to getcha off of my mind 
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time 
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again 
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win 

March was a cold one in more ways than one 
Went down to the nightclub lookin' for the sun 
Lookin' for a light that could brighten up a day 
That's been darker than a hole since you went away 

April usually brings showers 
This time it was a hurtin' kind 
This woman said she wanted my baby 
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind 
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew 
The baby would never really have a father 
Cause I still, 'cause I still, 'cause I still, still, still, huh 
Be stuck on you 

It took five women to getcha off of my mind 
Get off my mind, baby 
Fallin' in love all over...you I'll never win 

May was her name, she was jumpin' 
Jumpin' from plane to plane 
Actress or model or somethin' 
Can't even remember her first name 

June brought an Easter bunny 
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late 
Told a made-up story to a busy-body of our only date 
What a sketch! 

July was a heartbreak, extraordinary 
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary 
It felt so much, so much like yours 
But it only made me, made me want you more 
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here 
I want you very...huh, it's you I fear

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it

And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

And if that girlie don't return it

Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

"Say!
Everyone's talking 'bout chicken;
Chicken's a popular bird;
Anywhere you go, you're bound to find,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.

Some folks call it a fowl,
That's the story I heard,
But let 'em call it this and let 'em call it that,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.

You can boil it, roast it, broil it,
Cook it in a pan or a pot,
Eat it with potatoes, rice or tomatoes,
But chicken's still what you got, boy!

It was a dish for old Caesar,
Also King Henry the Third,
But Columbus was smart, said ""You can't fool me,
A chicken ain't nothin' but a bird.""

"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder

A fine romance, with no beaches
Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
Oh we don't have the thrills
That the march of time has

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong aged in the wood, woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No you like cactus plants
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my dear duchess
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
That the march of time has

You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No I prefer cactus plants

And there wasn't a soul in sight

And screeched to a grinding halt

And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead

And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens

Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said â??Boy you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind

Sock it to me
Well what's that supposed to mean
Boy you just a wild manâ??

Well then one day daddy told me â??Boy I've had enough

Called myself the Alabama wild man

Well I worked all them joints from the east to the west

A-living on coffee and cold sardines
Soda crackers and pork n beans

Said I'm the Alabama wild man and I'm here to stay
Took my guitar and showed â??em what I'm talking about
So we made a little record and we put it out

With me going
Sock it to me honey
Ha ha hook it boy
Play that guitar

Well now I'm driving the Cadillacs a city block long

And I'm working them shows
And people love me everywhere I go

I was a showing my home town and the place was packed
Guess who was sitting on the front row seat
Was my daddy grinning up at me batting at me

â??Sock it your daddy wild man
Hook it boy, hook it
Play that guitar show â??em son

Yeah that's my boy alright
Taught him everything he knows

"Well, if I don't love you baby
Grits ain't groceries, eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa was a man

I put on my good shoes
My arm are hard from what I do all day

The rain is gone, the night is new
The constellations are coming out again
And it's all for you
All for you

It's all for you
There are songs in the world
I'm singing softly as I drive
It's all for you cause you're the only girl
And I'm young again
And it feels so good to be alive

I'll take you out
We'll find a place to eat
Somewhere small, with a view
And later on we'll go dancing if you like
And it's all for you
All for you

To clear eyes and open hands
I'm getting stronger with each new day

"Sometimes when you worry
The tendency to hurry
Can make your vision blurry
And blind you
You might shake and you might stammer
Or dance like MC Hammer
But could that pomp and glamour
Remind you
Of who you are and where you're going
And whose mind that you're blowing
And if your car needs towing
Don't move
Then calmly call the AAA you've got nothing to prove
As in all things, it's all in the groove

All in the groove
All in the groove

Well if it's your destiny don't fight it
War between the states unite it
It might be difficult but might it
Be worthwhile?
I ain't no Solomon from Babel
But my cards are on the table
And I swear that if I'm able
I'll run that mile
So if I'm rambling ignore me
If on the money then adore me
You know the pearls are cast before me
Oh what to do?
Wish I could put it in a picture and hang it in the Louvre
But like I said before it's all in the groove
	
You could say it isn't worth it
Or maybe you could birth it
But if there's too much girth it
Won't move

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

The jam it swings and sways
As the groove funkily plays
And they say crime never pays
But this ain't no crime
It's just a life blood flowing water
That any son or daughter
Would send away for order
A celebration of time
So jam on, jam out, jam it in
Till it feels like it's a sin
And that's only when you begin
To improve
Don't mind if it's the rhythm that's just only when you've
Got to let it all be all in the groove

"Standing on top of the sunshine, holding my face to the wind
I smile and I wonder what it's all really supposed to be about
And then it came along and it hit me like a cool breeze
And it rubbed on my nose, as I undressed in the moment
The here and now of my reality that I embrace
Some, they never get that chance to feel such liberation
But me, I welcome it with open arms

And this is an awesome feeling. Sometimes I need to stop and take a breath
It's like you climbed the highest moment, sang the perfect harmony
That exact space where you knew you wanted to be
It was all you ever wanted was just a chance to be free
And you have it right now

So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Happiness is just a word if you don't know how it feels
Sadness an emotion that I refuse to make real
From now on I live my life and make my dreams real
No more fire without light, no more knowledge without zeal
No more tears without laughter, no more anger, no more hurt
I have to take all those things and then I throw them to the dirt
Time to set a course for greatness, time to lift my people up
No more walking into walls, find the doors to get unstuck
I have to fulfill my destiny, I am my Father's son
You can walk with me if you'd like, together we are one

Together we are strong, together we will win

Together we make things right, today it all begins
Tomorrow is a new day, history will remember us well
Yesterday is in the past, we've got new stories to tell
We've got new suns to kiss, new horizons to touch
In fact, I've really never wanted anything quite this much
So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

From a woman not approved of I suppose

Under the times in a drowning rain

To cool down the sinner's heat
I know this man, he's much like I

Sweltering in brandy-mire
And selling bitter meat

Exemplary of faith I guess
Starts with naught but soil
Upon the shoes of wayward men

Smite the temple yet again
Spill their precious oil

I'll mojo it with voodoo dust

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

The one I love will never know
As long as I stay

In this big town I find the peace of mind
That only losers in the game of love can find
The years have gone crawling by
This hurt I feel will never die
Somehow I know deep down inside
I'll never get away from this big town
From this big town

In this big town there's a street of misery
And on the street there's a dwelling place for me
In the darkness of my room I try
To sleep but all I do is cry
And still I realize that
I am ever lucky to be here

In this big town so no one else can see
Just what your cheating heart has done to me
The glimmer of the city lights
The shadows of the lonely nights
Will help to hide me while I cry
A hundred dreaded tears

(G) - (D)

(G) I'll sing you a true song of (D) Billy the (G) Kid
I'll (D) sing the record of (G) deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago
When a (G) man's only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four

Now when Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man

Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Before this young manhood reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty one men

It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men that I've put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two""

Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend
The poor outlaw's life have reached its sad end",Billy the Kid,Blues

I've been rolling like a stone; I never get back home

And, boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

Yeah, I traveled to the east and west for miles and miles and miles
And I've been long gone
And, boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

[Chorus]
Across the world I've seen
People and places
Could be the same
But with a different name

I wouldn't change the things I do for anything
But I'd just like to hear the message of the streets again
Give me a ticket
'Cause, boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

It may be kind of homely, but it sure is sweet
Industrial Revolution put it on its feet
But it's a long, long way
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

[Chorus]

I'll go and stay awhile and all the folks I meet
They'll say ""You won't stay long; you got them traveling feet
You'll soon be long gone

"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,Blues

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face

Until you bring back that little girl of mine""

Hallelujah, don't you know he made two?""

But I can't let her go, I'm hooked, I can't let her go
I can't let her go, Lord, I can't let her go

""Good Lord, I'd rather die than to let a no good
A no good cheating woman
Make me stand on the corner and cry""

Lord knows I'm living in a world of darkness
But that don't, that don't bother me
And until I find that sweet little girl of mine
Lord knows, I just don't want to see

But I can't let her go, Lord, I'm hooked

Shivered through some storms
Rained all night all alone

I can see that silver lining

Off my mailbox
Threw out some shoes and clothes
She left behind

I even took her picture
Off of my dresser

I've got the urge to dance
I can see myself again

Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody

With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet
Can take them

And though my window's got a view
Where the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for me now
So for now

I need this here

Oh, please just
Let me please breakdown

Well, this engine screams out loud
Sayin' the beat gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street that I'll never get to meet
These tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get to

If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept in, you know

You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows

You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose and you know

You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low and

Those gamblers put me down, yes, I had to walk right out of town
Um, um, that ain't no place to settle, um, I had to walk right out of town

Ah, but I hit the greatest town of all, Frantic Frisco

It's better than a cup of gold
See, only a chocolate Jesus
Can satisfy my soul

It's best to wrap your savior up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy but that's okay
Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait

Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights

It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.

Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?",Cold Cold Heart,Blues

Got up to play guitar and sing 
In some join in Mission Beach last night 
At the door sat Tom Waits 
In a pork pie hat and silver skates

Skinnin' a Hollywood movie star 
Can't remember where he parked his car 
Or to whom he lost the keys

Go on rhyme somethin' for em' man 
Show him how you really feel

Ain't no money in poetry 
That's what sets the poet free

Is all it takes to get me by 
Fool my belly till the day I die

Shootin' dice and playin' Ramblin' Jack's guitar

"As I was driving home along the boulevard late one night
I saw a guy in the corner, bumming all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out: ""Hey!""
I slowed down to see what he said, he said:

""Eh! By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said: ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""

It shoots tombstone bullets an' a ball and chain!""
He said: ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know

If the cops start to crowding me in
You're gonna be the first to go!
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back at nothin'

And he said: ""when you get to that red light
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""
He said: ""Now, I want you to park up in that alley
Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there

And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""

And always be on guard
'Cause when I come runnin' out the liquor store with all that money
He wanted me to mash on it real hard

He said: ""Now don't you come out of there an' try me a double-crossed

And said ""Oh there you are!""
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car!
When they put the handcuffs on him

I said: ""Child, your crime must have outgrew him!""

Puts shutters on the dreams.

With insufficient schemes.

The cracked brass bells will ring;

Whilst trampling on a flower.
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour.
The pattern juggler lifts his hand;

As slowly turns the grinding wheel
In the court of the crimson king.

On soft grey mornings widows cry,
The wise men share a joke.

To satisfy the hoax.

"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying in the Chapel,Blues

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,Blues

But son you better hope they keep the peace

The congregation's waiting at the altar
They can't find the preacher anywhere
They found him with the new girl from the choir
Where they store the boxes of the book of prayer

I don't want to know the bad
You wonder how it happened
They just picked it up from dad
While faded old glory is hanging like a rag
Defenders, defenders of the flag

The flag is flying high over the courthouse
The wheels of justice never stood a chance
The judge is down at charlies on his lunch hour
Checking out the picture show from France

Carrying a fifth of whiskey
In a dirty paper bag
Threw the ball to home
But they always missed the tag
Faded old glory hanging like a rag

Your powerful potion gets me every time

Soul possession
Got me in a trance
Pullin' me back to you

Driven by the chant calling out my name
I toss and turn, I can't sleep
Your kiss burns, through my dreams",Deja Voodoo,Blues

Knowing he could get by,

were not there to testify.

Hanging on every touch

Throw the map out of the window
Taking the long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own
Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we gonna do

Stopping every minute just because you're in it

Una canzone suonerà

E con le mani amore per le mani
Ti prenderò
E senza dire parole
Nel mio cuore ti porterò
E non avrò paura
Se non sarò bella come dici tu
Ma voleremo in cielo in carne e ossa
Non torneremo più

E senza fame senza sete
E senza aria e senza rete
Voleremo via

Quell'enorme mistero volò
Sola verso un cielo nero nero
S'incamminò
Tutti chiusero gli occhi
Nell'attimo esatto in cui sparì
Altri giurarono e spergiurarono
Che non erano mai stati lì

E con le mani amore
Con le mani ti prenderò

Some things
I can't explain

Shot the lot for credit and never got it back

Would eavesdrop 'cause they never hear no good, they say

And if I was broke he would turn my eyes all blue

They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye

"First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

"Did you ever hear the story
That happened not long ago
'Bout the man with a tan:
El diablo de Mexico?
And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw;
Now and then and again,
Found him steppin' outside of the law
Hey, hey!

And his fortune he had made
let him live high on the hog
Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog.
He was out on the run,
Knowing he could get by,
'Cause the men killed in sin
were not there to testify.
Hey, hey!

He was caught, he was bound
In La Casa de Calaboose.
He was tried; he was found
And readied for the noose.
But the break he would make,
It didn't turn out so well.
And the hombre called ""Diablo""
Bid his last farewell.",El Diablo,Blues
"I see you in the morning
You're the color of my rising sky
Freen sky above as my stone behind is a clearing
The opened storm been into
I have found my place of comfort and refuge
I can spend all my time right here by your side

Purple valley all covered in four leaf clovers
And your eyes, everlasting shades of blue
I'd share with you the smell
Sights and sounds of the springtime
Our love will grow with the rains that have fallen

Rolling down hills and climbing
Mountains and crossing oceans
Hand in hand together once again we stand",Electric Mile,Blues

You almost scared me to death
You elevate me so fast
I've to stop and catch my breath

C'est la plus belle de tout l' quartier

Hélas, lorsque je pense au prix de l'essence

Je perds subitement l'envie de m' la payer
Mais tout ceci ne m'empêche pas de penser
""Cette voiture-là, mon vieux

Attends un peu que je travaille
Quand je pourrai me la payer comptant
J'inviterai la belle fille à monter dedans
La capote baissée sans trop nous presser

Nous descendrons les Champs-Elysées
Et les copains nous voyant passer diront médusés
""Y a pas à dire, ce gars-là

Voilà que j'arrête ma vieille citron
Et j'ai bonne mine devant la belle maison

Je dirais certainement en parlant de moi

You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say good-bye

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby

A few drinks to calm me down
To settle my gut, to work up a smile
Because your bones are shakin'
Baby, agitate my nerves
I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll do this till I'm somebody else

Like Edgar Allan Poe
And I'll die on these streets of Baltimore
As a beggar, john, or buyer
Look, I'm just trying to score
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Plan A has got a boyfriend
But she melts to my touch
Plan B has got a crush
As much as she's got a lust
Plan C well, God forgive me
Well, she, she just lives to f*ck
I'll just act like I'm not in control
Well I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll take this, drink think, do this, smoke this
f*ck you while we're somebody else
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Shut up and dance
Ms. sings in her sleep
Ms. moves to my beat
What kind of secrets are we keeping tonight?
Because he's not here and he's not waiting up
How about another spin around the floor?
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Be sure I'm slutting it up
'Cause I know love's not enough
And I'll be outside the bar
Hopes for the back of her car
She's got wandering eyes
And much more curious lips
And I'm still betting every dime
She answers as her skirt slides over her hips",Erase You,Blues

"When traveling abroad in the continental style,
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet,
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique

And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse,
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town

Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit, you see, and never the arrest

Without fear of contradiction, bon voyage is always hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore,
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned
That she won't see him anymore

Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically
Evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you

And domestically approved romantic fancy,
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances,
Knowing it will only be parlayed into a memory",Foreign Affair,Blues

"What is a friend
Could it be that it's just a word

Cause you're my so-called friend

How could you call yourself a friend
Oh oh there goes that word again
That brings people together and tears them apart
It's always said by those who claim they love you
When all the while they want to fill your shoes
And never calling you up with no good news

They're always happy when your through
They never want the best for you
They're always trying to fill your shoes

Uh oh there goes that word again

And they want to hang out so you can spend on them

"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day
There must of been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
But when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said lets run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to that traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Look at Frosty go
Over the hills of snow",Frosty the Snowman,Blues
"Funny how the circle turns around
First you're up and then you're down again
Though the circle takes what it may give
Each time around it makes it live again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And you can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes you to fly
And if it's right it brings it back again.

Funny how the circle turns around
You think you're lost and then you're found again
Though you always look for what you know

Funny how the circle takes you to fly
And if it's right it brings it back again.

What did you bring me to keep me from the Gallows Pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold,
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the Gallows Pole.
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while,

Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the Gallows Pole?

I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the Gallows Pole.

Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand,
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man,
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man.

Pray tell me that I'm free to ride,

Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him he’s my daddy, yeah I love him he’s my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy

Sacrificing for the kids cause that’s what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candi says to stop, my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffing good

Just hoping I learned all their lessons

And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, Christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none

But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me

Yeah, they all hungry

Time is just a cumular limit,

Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the night wings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done

I'm coming home, this time I'm gonna stay
I'm coming home and I ain't never goin' away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see
When a woman looks a man in the eye

"As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands""

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

"""Rolling down the road, going nowhere,
Guitar packed in a trunk
Somewhere around mile marker 1-12,
Papa started hummin' the funk
I gotta jones in my bones before they know,
We were singing this melody
Stop the car pulled out the guitar,
Halfway to New Orleans

Said take me home
Take me home

Could feel the sun about to rise,
When I realized we had nothing to fear
It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope,
Making music that nobody would hear
And then the sun let up and it split the night,
Spillin' over our jubilee
Ten thousand cars by the side of the road,
Groovin' far as the eye can see

Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home
Said take me home

This Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy finally found,
Said this Greyhound is delta bound mama,
Baby boy done finally found his way home
Said take me home

Here we go,
Hot damn you should have felt the groove,
Like I was swimming in a sea of soul
The sun was rising and the day was hot,
And we was all about to lose control
My daddy turned his face up towards the sky,
And I knew that there was nothing to lose
I felt the crowd breathe in and I closed my eyes,
And we disappeared into the groove

Said take me home
Said take me home
Take me home
Said take me home

Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
Straight from the water, children
Straight from the water
You don't know nothin' about this

"I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me otherwise

Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young
I was scared, I was wrong

Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home

Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
Than never knowing

Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home, a home

Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my working day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule I guess that's true

Not a night goes by, I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been a home, a home",Home,Blues

And we'd been up many an hour
And all through my brain
Came the refrain
Of home and its warming fire

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
Fly over the mountain
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen
They come in between
The cities of tiring life
The trains come and go,
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

Traveling at night,
The headlights were bright.
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend
The flowers will send
The sweet smell of home in the breeze

"A junkie walking through the twilight
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago but no one seems to know
I'm gone

Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain
And it might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never went home again
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why

Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep sayin', kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it

God, but did you ever try to turn your sick soul
Inside out so that the world can watch you die
Home is where I live, inside my white power dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now
With my silent screams

Home is where the needle marks
Try to hear my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea
If i never, never went home again

Home again, home again, home again
Kick it quit it, kick it quit it, kick it quit it
Kick it, can`t go home again",Home Is Where the Hatred Is,Blues
"I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brother is my friend.

It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brother is my friend.

Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't
Pretend,
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.

Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,
That homeless brothe",Homeless Brother,Blues

"Baby born in New York City
Wrapped in a blanket all tattered and worn
Mama's doin' the best she can
It takes hope in a hopeless world

Her eldest son, he stayed in school
Listened to his mother, he never drank or used
But every job he wants he gets refused
It takes hope in a hopeless world

Looking for hope in a hopeless world
Trying to find love in these hateful times
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak
Looking for hope in a hopeless world

Churches are full, but the prayers are not heard
Saturday's child don't want to to go to Sunday school
Whatever happened to the golden rule
It takes hope in a hopeless world

D'you got a quarter for the homeless man
Spare some change for the soldiers who fought the war
Put a little money in those hats and those tins
Give them hope in a hopeless world

Looking for hope in a hopeless world
Searchin' for love in these hateful times
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak
Ease my mind, ease my mind

And on the corner there stands a young girl
The home she left was in the better part of town
Daddy did things she never talked about
It takes hope in a hopeless world

Somebody out there gotta listen
Somebody out there got to know what Pops been talkin' about
Raise your hand, raise your hands if you're with me
Give us hope in a hopeless world

You've got to listen to the voice inside
Peace and love don't compromise, realize
Time is passing by
Can't be standing still!",Hope in a Hopeless World,Blues
"(Oh, hot dog)
Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said ""you-haul"" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
But they just rolled my doll right out the door",Hot Dog,Blues
"She can burn you up in bed just like she said
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

She can boil a pot a' joe, she can start a pile a' dough, she's a hot head

She puts your head into the fire, makes your red-hot perspire, she's a hot head

She was burned before she was born, burnin up a storm, she's a hot head

Lick out like a flame, and burn you to a shame
Bite a burnin flame

She's a hobo wire-toaster
She's a circle on a spit (Ssssss!)

She can stick you to a wheel
Baste you to a fire
Spin you round and round
Boil your britches down

Is bumming from town to town

But what good does it do?

Of love, I thought was true
Your memory is chained to me

I can't escape from you

There is no end, I can't pretend
That dreams will soon come true
A slave too long to a heart of stone

I can't escape from you

And the creeps don't rise, we'll see you for long""

"A little jazz is just a bit of this and that
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the upbeat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin', it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie

But like a fool I went on
Whether they're right or wrong
At least the mystery is gone

The more I had to see
I had to find out for myself
What could she do for me

Her hands soft to touch
After just one kiss
I knew I was out of luck

From then on I was hers to control
And knowing that, she robbed me
Of my heart and robbed me of my soul

And the other filled with lies
She saw right through me
There was no place to hide

Now I've finally learned my lesson
But you'll never tell the pain her love left me
I hide so well, I go on day by day in fear
And knowing that I'll never, never love again
Only brings tears

I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say

And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do Lord, Lord

"Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues

And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue

She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?
You say 'anyway's the only way', be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues

But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues

Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues",Invitation to the Blues,Blues

Workin like a stripper like, oh woo oh
Come and take a sip of that, oh woo oh

Peel to the T in the V.I.P
Everybody drinkin in the bar on me
I spot a group of ladies with they eyes on me
And I ain't gotta pick one, I can have all three

Like, what's happenin ladies, I was seein you choosin
can't help but thinkin of you 3 in the noonin
Let's skip the game, cut that out of confusion
I'm tired of talking over all this loud music

Now let's go somewhere where we all can lose it
Listened to my offer and they couldn't refuse it
Got in the two do, started cruisin
We blew dro and they started removing

They wardrobe, they topless now
About 2 of those is poppin now
Touch here, kiss there, no stoppin now
She licked there and got her underwear broughten down

Oh baby?
